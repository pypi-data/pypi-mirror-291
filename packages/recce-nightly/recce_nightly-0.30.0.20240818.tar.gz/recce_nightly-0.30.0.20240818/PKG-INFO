`Recce` is a PR review tool designed for dbt projects. It facilitates the comparison of results between two environments, such as development and production, and helps in identifying any differences.

## Use cases

Recce is primarily designed for PR Review purposes. However, it can be expanded to the following use cases:

1. During development, we can verify new results by contrasting them with those from production prior to pushing the changes.
2. While reviewing PR, you can grasp the extent of the changes and their impact before merging.
3. For troubleshooting, you can execute ad-hoc diff queries to pinpoint the root causes.
