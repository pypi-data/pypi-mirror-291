ManiSkill is a powerful unified framework for robot simulation and training powered by [SAPIEN](https://sapien.ucsd.edu/). The entire stack is as open-source as possible and ManiSkill v3 is in beta release now. Among its features include:
- GPU parallelized visual data collection system. On the high end you can collect RGBD + Segmentation data at 20k FPS with a 4090 GPU, 10-100x faster compared to most other simulators.
- Example tasks covering a wide range of different robot embodiments (quadruped, mobile manipulators, single-arm robots) as well as a wide range of different tasks (table-top, locomotion, dextrous manipulation)
- GPU parallelized tasks, enabling incredibly fast synthetic data collection in simulation
- GPU parallelized tasks support simulating diverse scenes where every parallel environment has a completely different scene/set of objects
- Flexible task building API that abstracts away much of the complex GPU memory management code
