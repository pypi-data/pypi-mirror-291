## 4.1 Architectural Strategy

PromptArchitect's architecture is designed to prioritize the quality and reliability of AI interactions. The inclusion of a comprehensive Prompt Testing framework is a key aspect of this strategy. By incorporating semantic, format, and calculated tests, the system ensures that prompts are rigorously validated before deployment. This approach reduces the risk of errors, improves performance, and facilitates continuous refinement of prompts, aligning with the overall goal of delivering consistent and high-quality AI outputs.

PromptArchitect's architecture is designed with flexibility and user customization in mind. The introduction of a Command Line Interface (CLI) enhances the tool's flexibility, allowing it to be easily integrated into existing workflows and scripts. This is particularly beneficial for users who prefer or require non-GUI operations or who wish to automate prompt execution as part of larger pipelines.

Additionally, the support for customizable dashboard themes, exemplified by the `github-pajamas-theme`, allows organizations to tailor the user interface to match their branding and usability preferences. This approach aligns with the broader strategy of providing a highly adaptable tool that meets the diverse needs of its users.

## 4.1 Architectural Strategy

The introduction of template string substitution aligns with PromptArchitect's strategy of providing a flexible and scalable tool for managing AI interactions. By allowing users to dynamically substitute values into prompt templates, the system supports more adaptable and reusable prompts, reducing the need to create new prompts from scratch for every variation of a task.
