# 1. Introduction and Goals

## 1.1 Requirements Overview

### About Engineered Prompts and PromptArchitect

In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, the concept of an "engineered prompt" is gaining prominence, especially in environments leveraging large language models (LLMs) and other AI systems. Engineered prompts are meticulously crafted inputs designed to interact with AI models in a way that ensures consistent and reliable outputs. These prompts are structured tools integral to the automated processes in which they function.

PromptArchitect is a tool designed to facilitate the development, deployment, and management of engineered prompts. It provides a structured approach to creating inputs for AI models, ensuring precision, reusability, and scalability.

### Support for Ollama Models

PromptArchitect now supports the use of open-source models running locally via [Ollama](https://ollama.ai). This feature allows you to leverage powerful, locally hosted models such as Gemma2, Llama3.1, and Mistral, giving you greater control and flexibility over your AI model deployments.

#### Supported Models

- **Gemma2**: A robust and versatile model ideal for various natural language processing tasks.
- **Llama3.1**: An advanced model offering cutting-edge performance in language understanding and generation.
- **Mistral**: A lightweight, efficient model designed for quick responses and lower resource usage.

### Definition and Purpose

An engineered prompt is a carefully designed input used to generate a specific type of response from an AI model. Unlike casual or ad-hoc prompts, engineered prompts are developed through a rigorous process that considers the nuances of the model’s language understanding and output capabilities. They are akin to code in software development, serving as fundamental components that interact with AI to execute specific tasks reliably.

### Characteristics of Engineered Prompts

- **Precision and Clarity**: Engineered prompts are precise, unambiguous, and tailored to elicit specific responses or behaviors from AI models.
- **Reusability**: These prompts are designed to be reusable across similar tasks or models, ensuring efficiency and consistency in automated processes.
- **Scalability**: Engineered prompts can be scaled or modified according to different requirements or changes in the AI model’s behavior.

### Development and Maintenance

Just like software code, engineered prompts require a structured development and maintenance process to remain effective and safe for use:

- **Versioning**: Keeping track of different versions of prompts is crucial as models and requirements evolve. Versioning allows developers to manage changes systematically, revert to previous versions if needed, and understand the evolution of prompt effectiveness over time.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation detailing the design rationale, expected outputs, model compatibility, and dependencies is essential. This is vital for both current use and future modifications.
- **Testing and Validation**: Rigorous testing, including unit testing, integration testing, and validation testing, ensures the prompt generates the expected outputs.
- **Performance Tests**: Performance testing evaluates how well the prompt works in terms of speed and resource utilization, ensuring efficiency even at scale.
- **Regression Testing**: Particularly critical when the underlying AI model is updated or when switching to a model from a different provider, regression tests help verify that updates or changes do not negatively affect the prompt's performance.

## 1.2 Quality Goals

### Primary Quality Goals

1. **Reliability**: Ensure that prompts consistently produce the intended outputs.
2. **Efficiency**: Prompts should be efficient in terms of resource utilization and speed.
3. **Maintainability**: Prompts should be easy to maintain, with clear versioning and documentation.
4. **Scalability**: Prompts should be adaptable to different models and tasks without requiring extensive rework.
5. **Correctness**: Prompts must pass semantic, format, and calculated tests to ensure they generate accurate and reliable results.
6. **Consistency**: Prompts should perform consistently across different scenarios and model versions, validated through rigorous regression testing.
7. **Flexibility**: With the introduction of Ollama models, prompts must now seamlessly switch between local and cloud-hosted models to suit user needs.
8. **Flexibility**: Enhance the flexibility of prompt generation by allowing dynamic substitution of template strings, ensuring that the same prompt template can be reused for various scenarios with different input values.

### Secondary Quality Goals

1. **Usability**: Prompts should be user-friendly and easy to implement.
2. **Security**: Ensure that prompts do not expose vulnerabilities in the AI models.
3. **Cost Efficiency**: By enabling the use of locally hosted models, reduce reliance on cloud services and associated costs.

## 1.3 Stakeholders
