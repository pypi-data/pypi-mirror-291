# Simple ER Model

This Python package is automatically generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project:
It uses a customized template of the fastapi generator to only produce the pydantic modules and no actual API stuff.

This package therefore provides the basic model needed for all the tasks done by the FAIRlead schema extraction framework.

The parent framework can be found [here](https://github.com/Cpprentice/FAIRlead-model-extraction).
