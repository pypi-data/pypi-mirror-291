              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

**TensorTrade-NG was forked from the [TensorTrade](https://github.com/tensortrade-org/tensortrade)-Project, mainly because the code needed a lot refactoring, was outdated and it looked not really maintained anymore. Therefor we did a lot of breaking changes, removed old unused stuff and cleaned up. We tried to preserve the APIs but if you want to switch from TensorTrade to TensorTrade-NG be aware that it may take a little bit of effort. Apart from that we thank all the former developers and community for their awesome work and are happy to welcome them here.**

**TensorTrade-NG is still in Beta, meaning it should be used very cautiously if used in production, as it may contain bugs.**

TensorTrade-NG is an open source Python framework for building, training, evaluating, and deploying robust trading algorithms using reinforcement learning. The framework focuses on being highly composable and extensible, to allow the system to scale from simple trading strategies on a single CPU, to complex investment strategies run on a distribution of HPC machines.

Under the hood, the framework uses many of the APIs from existing machine learning libraries to maintain high quality data pipelines and learning models. One of the main goals of TensorTrade is to enable fast experimentation with algorithmic trading strategies, by leveraging the existing tools and pipelines provided by `numpy`, `pandas` and `gymnasium`. The idea behind Tensorflow-NG is not to implement all the machine learning stuff itself. But to provide a solid framework that makes it possible to quickly provide a working environment for other tools such as [Stable-Baselines3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io).

Every piece of the framework is split up into re-usable components, allowing you to take advantage of the general use components built by the community, while keeping your proprietary features private. The aim is to simplify the process of testing and deploying robust trading agents using deep reinforcement learning, to allow you and I to focus on creating profitable strategies.

_The goal of this framework is to enable fast experimentation, while maintaining production-quality data pipelines._

Read [the documentation](https://www.tensortrade.org/en/latest/).

## Guiding principles

_Inspired by [Keras' guiding principles](https://github.com/keras-team/keras)._

- **User friendliness.** TensorTrade is an API designed for human beings, not machines. It puts user experience front and center. TensorTrade follows best practices for reducing cognitive load: it offers consistent & simple APIs, it minimizes the number of user actions required for common use cases, and it provides clear and actionable feedback upon user error.

- **Modularity.** A trading environment is a conglomeration of fully configurable modules that can be plugged together with as few restrictions as possible. In particular, exchanges, feature pipelines, action schemes, reward schemes, trading agents, and performance reports are all standalone modules that you can combine to create new trading environments.

- **Easy extensibility.** New modules are simple to add (as new classes and functions), and existing modules provide ample examples. To be able to easily create new modules allows for total expressiveness, making TensorTrade suitable for advanced research and production use.

## Getting Started

You can get started testing on Google Colab or your local machine, by viewing our [many examples](https://github.com/erhardtconsulting/tensortrade-ng/tree/master/examples)

## Installation

TensorTrade requires Python >= 3.12.0 for all functionality to work as expected.
You can install TensorTrade both as a pre-packaged solution by running the default setup command.
```bash
pip install tensortrade
```
You can then alternatively install TensorTrade directly from the master code repository, pulling directly from the latest commits. This will give you the latest features\fixes, but it is highly untested code, so proceed at your own risk.
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/erhardtconsulting/tensortrade-ng.git
```
Alternatively you can clone\download the repository in your local environment an manually install the requirements, either the "base" ones, or the ones that also include requirements to run the examples in the documentation.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r examples/requirements.txt
```

## Docker

To run the commands below, ensure Docker is installed. Visit https://docs.docker.com/install/ for more information.

### Run Jupyter Notebooks

To run a jupyter notebook in your browser, execute the following command and visit the `http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=...` link printed to the command line.

```bash
make run-notebook
```

### Build Documentation

To build the HTML documentation, execute the following command.

```bash
make run-docs
```

### Run Test Suite

To run the test suite, execute the following command.

```bash
make run-tests
```
