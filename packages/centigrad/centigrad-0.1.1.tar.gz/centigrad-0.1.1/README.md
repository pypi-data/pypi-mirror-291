# centigrad

This is a project that begun as a blind replication of Andrej Kharpaty's micograd [repo](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd/tree/master). I say a blind replication because I started watching Andrej's YouTube video [The spelled-out intro to neural networks and backpropagation: building micrograd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0&list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ) from his "Neural Networks: Zero to Hero" series.

Following Andrej's examples of building things from scratch, I decided to pause the video, grasps some important concepts from the minutes I watched and keep the development myself to then compare my solution to his. I was surprised to find similitudes between our solutions, which I will comment later.

I made this replication with almost null notion of TensorFlow or Pytorch frameworks. After I reached a stable state of my solution I finished watching Andrej's video. I may do similar replications of the rest of his series.

# Installation

```
pip install centigrad
```

# Usage

Some examples of the usage of the 3 classes in the package can be found below. There are included some supported operations and most important methods. For more detail about the implementation, please reference the notebooks with the name of each object.

## Variable

As example of the Variable object, the following expression would be constructed:

```
from centigrad.variable import Variable



```
