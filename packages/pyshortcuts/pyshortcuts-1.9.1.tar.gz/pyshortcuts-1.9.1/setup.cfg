description = Create desktop and Start Menu shortcuts for python scripts
long_description = 
	Pyshortcuts helps developers and Python users to create shortcuts on a
	Users Desktop or Start Menu that will run python scripts and applications.
	Pyshortcuts is cross-platform, supporting Windows, MacOS, and Linux each in
	the way most natural for the OS.  On Windows, a Shortcut or Link is
	created.  On Linux a ".desktop" file is created.  On MacOS, a minimal
	Application is created.  In all cases, the shortcuts are put either
	directly on the Desktop or Start Menu , or in a folder on the Desktop or
	Start Menu of the current user.  That means that there is not need for
	elevated permission or writing to system-level files (registry,
	/Applications, /usr/bin).  The user has complete control to rename, move,
	or delete the shortcut after it is created.  Shortcuts can have a custom
	icon (`.ico` files on Windows or Linux, or `.icns` files on MacOS)
	specified, defaulting to a Python icon included with the pyshortcuts
	module. Pyshortcuts is pure python, has a small footprint and is very easy
	to install and use either from a python script.  That is to say, it can
	easily be part of a installation (or post-installation process) process for
	larger packages.
