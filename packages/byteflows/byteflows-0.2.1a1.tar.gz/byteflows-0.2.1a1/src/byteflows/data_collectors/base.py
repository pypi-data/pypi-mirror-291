class BaseDataCollector(ByteflowCore):
    """
    Base data collector class. Data collectors are objects that directly make a request to a resource,
    call the data handler pipeline, and send data to the store. Data collectors take into account the
    restrictions associated with the resource, such as the rate limit, the interval for processing the
    resource, and the data format received when accessing the resource. For each instance of a request
    to a resource, a data collector is created.
    At the moment, only work with API resources is available.

    Attributes:
        delay (int | float): delay before sending requests.
        timeout (int | float): waiting time for a response from the data source.
        collect_trigger (ActionCondition): a trigger, the firing of which allows you to begin processing the data source.
        eor_status (bool): the status of no payload in the data source.
        _write_channel (ContentQueue): a buffer in memory in which data is stored before uploading to the backend.
        url_series (AsyncGenerator): a link generator created by a Request instance.
        pipeline (IOBoundPipeline): an instance of the pipeline class associated with a request that is processed by the data collector.
        input_format (str): format of incoming data.
        output_format (str): the format in which the data should be saved.
        path_producer (PathTemplate): data path generator.
