# Clouds

_Clouds_ is a turn-based _serious game_ simulating planning of an Earth observation satellite trying to gain maximum
points while reducing cloud covered pictures.

As it is intended to be played among others in the [Mathecamp 2024](https://www.mathezirkel-augsburg.de/veranstaltung/mathecamp/),
classes, variables and methods as well as docstrings for those objects that are relevant to the player are in German.
