# Audit Ninja

## Overview

Audit Ninja is a middleware package designed to provide comprehensive auditing for your Django applications. It monitors and records changes across network data and Django models, ensuring that all relevant information, such as IP addresses and user details, is logged and stored securely.

## Features

- **Network Data Monitoring**: Tracks network data including IP addresses and user details.
- **Model Change Detection**: Automatically checks for any changes in the Django models where the package is imported.
- **Authorization Checks**: Ensures that all actions are authorized before recording them.
- **Data Storage**: Stores all audit data in a MongoDB database. Requires credentials for the Django database instance.

## Installation

To install Audit Ninja, use `pip`:

```bash
pip install audit_ninja
```

## Configuration

- **Django Settings**: Add the middleware to your MIDDLEWARE setting in settings.py:
```python
MIDDLEWARE = [
    # other middleware
    'audit_ninja.middleware.AuditMiddleware',
]
```
- **MongoDB Settings**: Configure the MongoDB connection in your settings.py:
```python
AUDIT_MONGO_DB = {
    'host': 'your-mongodb-host',
    'port': 27017,
    'db_name': 'your-database-name',
    'user': 'your-username',
    'password': 'your-password',
}
```
- **Database Credentials**: Ensure that the package has access to the Django database credentials for authorization checks.

## Usage
Once installed and configured, Audit Ninja will automatically start monitoring network data and changes in your Django models. You can customize the behavior by adjusting the settings in your settings.py file.
