# 🥯 Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML)

This repository implements privacy-preserving machine learning techniques, starting with a differentially private GAN for image generation. Our goal is to develop and showcase various PPML methods that enable data analysis and model training while protecting individual privacy.

Our [blog post](https://blog.bagel.net/p/data-synthesis) explains the importance of privacy in machine learning and introduces our first implementation. 🥯

## 🥯 Features

- Privacy-preserving machine learning techniques
- Differential privacy implementations
- PyTorch and Opacus integration

## 🥯 Current Implementations

1. Differentially Private GAN (DP-GAN) for image synthesis
   - Based on [Radford et al. (2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434) and [Xie et al. (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06739)
   - Convolutional GAN architecture
   - Customizable privacy budget (ε)

## 🥯 Applications

Our PPML techniques can be applied to various scenarios:

- Secure data sharing for research
- Privacy-preserving model training
- Confidential data analysis in sensitive domains (e.g., healthcare, finance)
- Building privacy-respecting AI systems

## 🥯 Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/PPML.git
   cd PPML
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -e .
   ```

## 🥯 Usage

### DP-GAN for Image Synthesis

1. Place your dataset in the `data` folder. The default configuration expects a folder structure similar to the CelebA dataset.

2. Open `dp.py` and set the `dataroot` variable to point to your dataset folder:
   ```python
   dataroot = "path/to/your/dataset"
   ```

3. (Optional) Adjust hyperparameters in `dp.py`:
   - `EPSILON`: Privacy budget (default: 50.0)
   - `batch_size`: Number of images per batch (default: 128)
   - `num_epochs`: Number of training epochs (default: 5)
   - `lr`: Learning rate (default: 0.0002)

4. Run the training script:
   ```
   python dp.py
   ```

5. Monitor the training progress. The script will print loss values and privacy guarantees every few iterations.

6. After training, find the trained Generator model saved as `netG_dpgan.pth` in the project directory.

7. To generate new images using the trained model, create a new script that loads the saved model and feeds random noise through it.

## 🥯 Example

We trained the DP-GAN on CelebA with ε=50. Results:

## 🥯 Roadmap

We plan to expand this repository with more PPML techniques, including:

- Federated Learning implementations
- Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) for distributed machine learning
- Homomorphic Encryption-based machine learning models
- Privacy-preserving data analysis tools

Stay tuned for updates!
