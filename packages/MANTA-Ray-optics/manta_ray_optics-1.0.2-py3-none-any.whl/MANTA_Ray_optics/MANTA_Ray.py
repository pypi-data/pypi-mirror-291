        ----   MANTA-Ray (Modified Absorption for Nonspherical Tiny Aggregates in the Rayleigh regime)   ----   

                                                                                 Matt Lodge (20/08/24)

This code estimates the absorption cross-sections of fractal aggregate dust/aerosol particles using the MANTA-Ray model (Lodge et al. 2024)
The inputs are the wavelength, particle size, particle shape and refractive index, and the output is absorption efficiency (and there is
also an option to directly calculate absorption cross-section).

Absorption efficiencies are estimated by using a multi-variate quadratic fit to data obtained by the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) for a range
of shapes from compact (d_f = 2.7) to linear (d_f = 1.2). See paper for more details, as well as average and maximum expected errors for each
shape type.

The model is bi-modal, and this particular version uses linear interpolation to join the two quadratic models in the region of (n,k) space bounded by:

    n+2=k    and    n+3=k

This linear interpolation blends the two regimes together at the boundary smoothly, rather than having a "hard" boundary to move between them (a step 
function between regimes would not represent the expected optical properties well -- see Appendix A of Lodge et al. 2024). The exact position is somewhat
arbitrary and purely a modelling decision, but we have found that the above choice for the region of "overlap" allows a smooth transition between the two modes.

# The main function below (find_Q_abs) calculates absorption efficiency (using Eq. 5 of Lodge et al. 2024) given the following variables:
#
#       wavelength: the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation (in um).
#
#       radius: the volume-equivalent spherical radius of the particle (in um). This is the radius of a sphere that would have the same volume 
#       as the fractal aggregate. Note that to be in the Rayleigh regime, and for this theory to work, it is assumed that wavelength > 100*radius,
#       and the code will return an error message if this condition is not true.
#
#       d_f: the fractal dimension of the aggregate. The code has been tested for values between 1.2 (linear) and 2.7 (compact).
#
#       n,k: the real (n) and imaginary (k) components of refractive index respectively.
