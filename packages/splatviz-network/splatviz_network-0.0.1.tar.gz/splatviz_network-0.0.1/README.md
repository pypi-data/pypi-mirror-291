#  splatviz network
In order to edit the scene while it is still training, you will have to use the custom splatviz network connector. To do so, follow the four simple steps:

### Step 1
Copy `splatviz_network.py` into your gaussian splatting project and import the file as follows in your train script:
```python
from splatviz_network import SplatvizNetwork
```

### Step 2 
At the beginning of the train script, create the network connector:
```python
network = SplatvizNetwork()
```

### Step 3
Call the render function inside the training loop:
```python
network.render(pipe, gaussians, ema_loss_for_log, render, background, iteration, opt)
```

### Step 4
Remove all previously defined `network_gui` calls in the train script.

## Example Diff
For the vanilla 3DGS train.py the diff should look as follows:
