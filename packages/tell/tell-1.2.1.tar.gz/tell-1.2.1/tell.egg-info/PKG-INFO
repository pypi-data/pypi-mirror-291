## tell

#### `tell` is an open-source Python package to model future hourly total electricity loads.

### Purpose
`tell` was created to:

  - Project the short- and long-term evolution of hourly electricity demand in response to changes in weather and climate.

  - Work at a spatial resolution adequate for input to a unit commitment/economic dispatch (UC/ED) model.

  - Maintain consistency with the long-term growth and evolution of annual state-level electricity demand projected by an economically driven human-Earth system model.

### Install `tell`

`tell` is available via GitHub repository by using the pip install functionality. `tell` requires a Python version between 3.8 and 4.0 as well as a pip install to import the package. `tell` has been tested on
Windows and Mac platforms. (Note: For those installing on Windows, `tell`  is supported by GeoPandas functionality.  Please see suggestions for installing GeoPandas on Windows here:  
https://geopandas.org/en/stable/getting_started/install.html)

```bash
pip install tell
```
