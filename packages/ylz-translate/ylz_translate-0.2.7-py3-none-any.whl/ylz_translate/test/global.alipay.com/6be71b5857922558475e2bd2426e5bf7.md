More information 
-----------------

This section provides additional information about key parameters. See the following list for details:

*   _paymentTime_: The successful execution time of this payment by Alipay, that is, the date and time when the payment reaches a final state of success. This value is used as the start time of the subsequent cancellable and refundable time. For example, if the refundable time is 6 months, the final time to accept the refund is _paymentTime_ plus 6 months.
*   To decide when to use _paymentRequestId_ or _paymentId_, follow these rules:

*   If the **pay** API call returns successfully, use _paymentId_ or _paymentRequestId_ to inquire about the payment result.
*   If the **pay** API call returns unknown exceptions or timeouts, use _paymentRequestId_ to inquire about the payment result.
*   If the **cancel** API call returns unknown exceptions or times out, use _paymentId_ or _paymentRequestId_ of the original payment to inquire about the cancel result.

Result process logic
--------------------

For different request results, different actions are to be performed. See the following list for details:

*   If the value of _result.resultStatus_ is `S`, the **inquiryPayment** API is called successfully. You can get the payment result from the _paymentStatus_ field of the API response.
*   If the value of _result.resultStatus_ is `F`, the **inquiryPayment** API call failed. You cannot get the payment result from the API response.
*   If the value of _result.resultStatus_ is `U`, the status of the **inquiryPayment** API call is unknown. Use the same request parameters to retry the **inquiryPayment** API.
