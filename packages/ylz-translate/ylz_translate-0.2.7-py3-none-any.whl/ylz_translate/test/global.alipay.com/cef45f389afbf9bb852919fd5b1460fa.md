Best practices for BNPL channels
================================

2023-03-16 08:08

Alipay is planning to add some payment methods with the Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) feature. BNPL is a type of installment loan, which gives a user a certain credit line that is long-term effective and recyclable. The user can use this credit line for transactions. However, payment methods still need to apply real-time risk control to BNPL transactions to reduce risks on the user side and the payment method side, which requires merchants to provide specific information in the API request to Alipay. The required information is categorized into basic ones and extended ones, and they have a heavy impact on the success of payments.
