cancel

POST /v1/subscriptions/cancel

Use the **cancel** API to cancel or terminate a subscription. Canceling a subscription means that the service is not provided to the user after the current subscription period ends, and terminating a subscription means the service ceases immediately.

Structure
=========

A message consists of a header and body. The following sections are focused on the body structure. For the header structure, see：

*   [Request header](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/api_fund#ML5ur)
*   [Response header](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/api_fund#WWH90)  
    

**Note**: Set the data type of each field (except array) as String. This means that you must use double quotation marks (" ") to enclose the field value. Examples:

*   If the data type of a field is Integer and its value is 20, set it as "20".
*   If the data type of a field is Boolean and its value is true, set it as "true".
