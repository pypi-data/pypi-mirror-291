The cross-border app payment solution provides a convenient, safe, and reliable payment services to third-party applications. This payment solution is applicable to wireless devices (including mobiles and tablet computers) supported by Android or iOS system.

With this payment solution, the merchant's site will present an Alipay payment button when a consumer completes the payment and checks out.

*   The user clicks the payment/checkout button. After being redirected to Alipay app/H5 page, the user can log in, and then complete the payment on Alipay.
*   Once the payment is completed, the user is redirected back to the merchant site with the payment result. The merchant could check the result and make decision on how to move forward.
*   In the meantime, an asynchronous notification will be sent to the merchant with the payment result. The notification is reliable with build-in retry mechanism.
