How to test other payment methods
=================================

2024-05-17 09:12

This article covers testing steps of payment methods other than cards and Alipay+ payment methods. The payment experience of these payment methods includes making payment with a text code, QR code, an account and password, or redirection. Follow the steps below to test those payment methods.

Call the **pay** API to obtain the payment continuation URL.

Login page with account and password
------------------------------------

If the URL leads to a login page with account and password required, enter any value and click **Pay** to complete the payment.

Code
----

If the URL leads to a page displaying a QR code or text code, complete the payment as suggested below:

### QR code

If the code is a QR code, click on the QR code to complete the payment.

Redirect to test wallet app
---------------------------

When making payments through bank apps, you need to redirect to the wallet app to complete the payments. Download the test wallet app and use the payment continuation URL returned by Antom to open the app.
