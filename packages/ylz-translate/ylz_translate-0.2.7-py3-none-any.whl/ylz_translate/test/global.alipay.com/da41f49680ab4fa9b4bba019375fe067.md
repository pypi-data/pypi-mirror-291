Antom guides to help you manage and resolve disputes effectively. It is essential that both parties understand and adhere to the dispute processing principles outlined in this document.

### Your Responsibilities

As a merchant, it is your responsibility to ensure the fulfillment of transactions, provide high-quality customer service, and proactively address potential cardholder disputes.

When you receive a dispute, you need to take the following actions:

*   Review the cardholder's claim.
*   Decide how to respond to the dispute.
*   Collect relevant evidence to refute the claim.
*   Provide a response and evidence to Antom within the required time frame.

**Note**: Submitting evidence indicates that you challenge the dispute and, if applicable, request the return of funds. Once submitted, the evidence cannot be altered. It is your responsibility to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the evidence provided.

### Antom's Responsibilities

When a dispute happens, Antom will take the following actions:

*   Notify you of the dispute received and the necessary details of disputes relating to the payments.
*   (If applicable) Freeze and debit the disputed amount, plus a dispute fee, from your account once a chargeback happens (For information about fees, contact BD).
*   Walk you through the steps of submitting convincing evidence to refute the chargeback.
*   Communicate the outcome of the chargeback with you once the Issuer has evaluated your evidence and determined the chargeback liability.
*   (If applicable) Credit the disputed amount from your account if the final result is in favor of the merchant.

Throughout this process, Antom facilitates the dispute case, but it is your liability to check the refund status, prepare the defense documents, and provide them within the prespecified timeframe. Antom does not influence the outcome, which is at the sole discretion of the account ownerâ€™s bank or card scheme. In no event will Antom be liable to compensate merchants, sellers, or any other person for any loss suffered in connection with disputes.

### Other requirements

If you challenge a dispute, you need to ensure you know the specific reason code for the dispute and provide evidence that satisfies the defense criteria for the specific dispute reason. In addition, you must ensure that all information and documents related to the dispute adhere to the following criteria:

*   Authentic, complete, and legible.
*   Provided in English (non-English materials must be accompanied by English translation).
