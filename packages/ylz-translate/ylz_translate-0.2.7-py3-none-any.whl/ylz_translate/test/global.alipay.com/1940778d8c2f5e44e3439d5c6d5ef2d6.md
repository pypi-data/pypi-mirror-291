*   Reconciliation files in the sandbox environment are only for reference. For example, the fields in the reconciliation files obtained from the sandbox environment and production environment might be different. Refer to the files obtained in the production environment for details.
*   No actual settlement occurs in the sandbox environment, therefore the settlement file in the sandbox environment only contains the file head.
