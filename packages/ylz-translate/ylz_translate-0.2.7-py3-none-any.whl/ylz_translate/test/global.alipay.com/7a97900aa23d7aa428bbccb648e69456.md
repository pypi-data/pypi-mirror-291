Introduction
============

2023-09-13 03:49

The Alipay Order Code Payment enables merchants and customers a smooth payment experience.

To initiate a payment, the merchant generates a QR code with the order information for customers to scan. After scanning the code, the customer can check the order information before completing the payment.

This payment method is suitable for retail and self-service scenarios as customers can complete payments without entering the payment amount, and get the payment result instantly.

Product flow
============

The merchant sends a request for Alipay to create an order QR code. Alipay returns a QR code to the merchant, which can be presented to the user to be scanned. After scanning the QR code, Alipay+ Mobile Payment Provider (Alipay+ MPP) gets the order details for the user to confirm. If the user confirms to pay, Alipay+ MPP processes the payment and sends the payment status notification to Alipay. Alipay returns the payment status notification to the merchant.
