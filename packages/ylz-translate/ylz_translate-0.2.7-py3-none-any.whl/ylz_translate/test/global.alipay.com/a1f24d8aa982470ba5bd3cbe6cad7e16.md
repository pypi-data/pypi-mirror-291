Product flow
============

The user scans the entry code and enters the payment amount to complete the payment. A payment request is initiated and sent to Alipay. Alipay processes the payment and returns the payment scheme to the request initiator. The request initiator triggers the cashier in the customer wallet to make the customer confirm the payment. Alipay+ Mobile Payment Provider (Alipay+ MPP) receives the confirmed payment and presents the payment result page to the customer. Alipay+ MPP also sends the payment status notification to Alipay. After getting the payment result from Alipay+ MPP, Alipay sends the payment status notification to the merchant.
