Antom offers flexible anti-fraud options to merchants, allowing you to independently manage anti-fraud decisions or to leverage third-party fraud prevention services. We provide a 3D-secure tool to facilitate transactions that use 3DS verification.

Antom will help you monitor fraud and chargeback rates, and send alerts when they near the thresholds set by Card Scheme programs. A risk control specialist will help you understand the card scheme program, and propose a feasible plan to avoid further loss. In case of being picked up by the Standard/Excessive program, we can help you prepare a remedy plan as required by the Card Scheme.

In addition, Antom also provides a value-added service called “Premium Risk Solution”. This service draws upon a decade of expertise and state-of-the-art technology to deliver real-time, dynamic 3DS-based decisions, optimizing the balance between minimizing fraud losses and maximizing transaction approval rates. If you are interested, contact BD or your account manager, so we can analyze your situation and tailor a solution for you.

The following fraud-prevention steps are industry best practices for online merchants. You need to take proactive steps to detect and prevent fraud. These best practices can be implemented individually or in conjunction with other indicators.

##### Be cautious of unusual transactions

Unusual transactions such as large order quantities and high frequency of placing orders are a warning sign of fraudsters using stolen cards to make fraudulent purchases. To reduce the risk of fraud, monitor and analyze previous sales data to understand your normal sales each day, recognize any unusual or sudden changes in the transactions, and block orders that supersede this volume or frequency.

##### Leverage geolocation technology and verification tools

Inconsistencies between a customer's billing, shipping, or card information may be an indication of fraud. Check the geolocation by IP address to understand the payer’s precise location (country) and compare it with the billing address (country) to identify any discrepancy. Ensure that the country of the card issuer matches the billing address country. Also, verify if orders are being shipped to high-risk international locations known for credit card fraud. Leverage geolocation technology and use a Card Verification Number and Address Verification System to detect suspicious orders and subject them to a manual review.

##### Collect proof of delivery

Partner with reputable shipping providers that offer confirmed delivery services, which can serve as evidence against unfounded customer claims of undelivered orders.

##### Build your own blocklist

Build a customer blocklist that contains names, credit card numbers, IP addresses, and shipping addresses known to be fraud risks. Any newly placed orders with information that matches the blocklist can be blocked.
