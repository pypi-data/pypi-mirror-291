Alipay APIs
===========

Alipay APIs
-----------

Designed to be clear, concise, and easy to integrate, Alipay APIs aim to reduce the complexity of high-availability applications and shorten development time. Alipay APIs are based on the HTTP protocol and are POST APIs, which use SHA256 and RSA algorithms to create digital signatures, accept JSON-encoded request bodies, and return JSON-encoded responses. The API request includes the API URL in the path, identity and signature information in the request header, and request parameters in the request body.

Call an API
-----------

To integrate with Alipay, you need to first make preparations in the [Antom Dashboard](http://global.alipay.com/docs/dashboard_en) and get your client ID. You can then improve the integration by using Alipay APIs in a test mode, which does not affect your live data. We encourage testing the API call in the sandbox environment before launching your project and going live.

You can use Alipay-provided open SDKs to integrate with Alipay. If the programming language you use is Java, PHP, or Python, you can complete the process of assembling, signing, calling and checking the result of the HTTP request through the SDK provided by Alipay. Alipay SDKs encapsulate the process of integration, including adding and validating signatures for calling Alipay APIs.

CLIENT LIBRARIES

For different payment scenarios, specific SDKs for Java, PHP, and Python are provided. Use the right SDK according to your need. Refer to the README.md section to learn more about how to use SDKs.

The request address for the production and sandbox environments is only different in the path part of the request. You can first test Alipay APIs in the sandbox environment, which does not affect your data in the production environment. Once you have finished testing, migrate to the production environment by changing the request URL and other configurations.

| Environment | Request URL |
| --- | --- |
| Sandbox | https://<domain\_name>/ams/sandbox/api/<endpoint> (Online payments)  
https://<domain\_name>/ams/api/<endpoint> (In-store payments) |
| Production | https://<domain\_name>/ams/api/<endpoint> (Online payments)  
https://<domain\_name>/ams/api/<endpoint> (In-store payments) |

The domain name can be obtained from Alipay, and you can select one of the supported domain names listed below according to your region. If you are not sure which domain to use, contact Technical Support at overseas\_support@service.alibaba.com for help.

| Location | Domain Name |
