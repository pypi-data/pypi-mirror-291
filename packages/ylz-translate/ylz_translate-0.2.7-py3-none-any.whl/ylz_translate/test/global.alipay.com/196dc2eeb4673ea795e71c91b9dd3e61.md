createPaymentSession (EasySafePay)
==================================

2024-05-09 06:39

POST /v1/payments/createPaymentSession

The **createPaymentSession** API is used to generate a payment session for integrating client-side SDK. The API response provides encrypted session data, which can be used to initiate the client-side SDK. This SDK streamlines the payment process and frees you from manually calling multiple APIs.

Structure
=========

A message consists of a header and body. The following sections are focused on the body structure. For the header structure, see：

*   [Request header](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/api_fund#ML5ur)
*   [Response header](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/api_fund#WWH90)

**Note**: Set the data type of each field (except array) as String. This means that you must use double quotation marks (" ") to enclose the field value. Examples:

*   If the data type of a field is Integer and its value is 20, set it as "20". 
*   If the data type of a field is Boolean and its value is ​`true`​, set it as "true".

More information
----------------

About the _order_ field: Alipay does not verify the consistency of the amount in the _order_ field and the amount in the payment request. The order information is not applied in fund operations either. This field is mainly used for risk control, supervision, regulatory reporting, and consumption records display. Use the _env_ field if the risk control capability provided by Alipay is needed.
