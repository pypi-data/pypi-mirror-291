EasySafePay allows you quickly and easily build a secure and simple payment experience for your website or application. Buyers can enable password-free payments during their first-time payment without being redirected to the payment method client for authorization. The payment process remains completely within your client, thereby enhancing buyer conversion rates and payment success rates.

Key features
============

EasySafePay boasts the following product highlights:

*   **Minimalist payment experience**: For the first-time payment, buyers only need to link their accounts and pay to enjoy one-click payments in the future.
*   **Enhanced Security**: EasySafePay allows buyers to remove linked accounts at any time and supports large-value payment confirmation to provide an extra layer of protection. The dynamic loading technology from a Webview container and Antom network acceleration engines are used to enhance payment security.
*   **Light-weight Integration**: A one-time integration process saves your further development efforts, and EasySafePay will always provide the latest payment experience for your buyers. Furthermore, EasySafePay supports multiple clients, provides localized pages, and offers intelligent recommendations for local payment methods.
