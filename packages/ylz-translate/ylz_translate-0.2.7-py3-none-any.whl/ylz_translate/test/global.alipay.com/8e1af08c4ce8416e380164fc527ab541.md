What is Alipay Red Packet QR Code?
----------------------------------

Red Packet QR Codes are offline marketing QR codes that Alipay launched overseas (outside Chinese mainland) in 2018. If an overseas merchant accepts Alipay as a payment method, a Chinese Alipay user can scan the Red Packet QR Code to get a red packet for payment deduction. A campaign partner can earn commissions from Red Packet QR Code POSM placement and user redemptions of red packets.

\*The abbreviation of Red Packet QR code： RP QR Code

Red Packet QR Code Incentive Scheme
-----------------------------------

There are two parts of the incentive our service providers can earn from one Red Packet QR Code:

1.     **Placement Commission**: From April 1, 2023, a service provider can earn X RMB (or the local currency equivalent) for a successful redemption through an Alipay Red Packet QR code placed by the service provider into the storefront of a merchant. A successful redemption means an Alipay user generated and redeemed a Red Packet coupon through the Alipay Red Packet QR code placed by the service provider. The said merchant must meet either of the following two requirements:

*   The merchant accepts Alipay as a payment method but has not yet accepted Alipay Red Packet QR Code redemption.
*   The merchant accepts Alipay as a payment method and has accepted Alipay Red Packet QR Code redemption. But the merchant has no Red Packet Code redemptions across 2022.

2.     **Operations Commission**: From April 1, 2023, service providers can earn an Operations Commission from each Alipay Red Packet QR Code redemption. Operations Commissions are calculated as factor \* Alipay Red Packet QR Code redemption amount. For each Alipay Red Packet QR code, a service provider can earn no more than n Operations Commissions per month. The factor will vary in different business districts/regions and can change from time to time. An Operations Commission is effective for 12 months after the Alipay Red Packet QR Code is activated.

A service provider can earn no more than 500,000 RMB from Placement Commissions and Operations Commissions per month.

Incentive Settlement
--------------------

The incentive will be calculated and settled to your registered bank account at the end of every month. The Service Providers can check the monthly statement at the Alipay Global Open Platform.

Service Provider Qualifications
