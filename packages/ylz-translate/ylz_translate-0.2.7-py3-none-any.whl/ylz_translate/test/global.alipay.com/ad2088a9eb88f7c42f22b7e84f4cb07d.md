The Address Verification System and Card Verification Value are security methods used during card payments to prevent fraud.

Address Verification System
---------------------------

Address Verification System (AVS) is a service to verify the billing address provided by the card user during a transaction with the cardholder's billing address on record at the issuing bank. AVS helps to prevent suspicious transactions and credit card fraud.

You can use the AVS result codes returned by Alipay to check whether the buyer of a transaction is the same person as the cardholder. If the billing address information matches, the buyer is more likely the cardholder.

### How to get AVS result code

First, the cardholder's billing address details need to be collected. You can collect the billing address by yourself and pass the information to Alipay through _paymentMethod.paymentMethodMetaData.billingAddress_ in the [**pay (Checkout Payment)**](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/payment_cashier) API, otherwise Alipay collects this information.

AVS checks whether the collected billing address information matches the address on file with the issuing bank of the cardholder. You can get the AVS result code through _paymentResultInfo.avsResultRaw_ in the following APIs:

*   in the response body of the [**pay (Checkout Payment)**](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/payment_cashier) API
*   in the response body of the [**inquiryPayment**](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/paymentri_online) API
*   in the request body of the [**notifyPayment**](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/paymentrn_online) API

### AVS result codes

The values of _paymentResultInfo.avsResultRaw_ and corresponding meanings are as follows:



| **AVS result code** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| A | Address (Street) matches. Zip code does not match. |
| B | Street address matches for international transactions. Postal code not verified due to incompatible formats. |
| C | Street address and postal code not verified for international transactions due to incompatible formats. |
| D | Street address and postal code match for international transactions. Cardholder name is incorrect. |
| E | AVS error. |
| F | Address does match and five-digit ZIP code does match (UK only). |

| O | Cardholder name and address match (Amex). |
| P | Postal codes match for international transactions. Street address not verified due to incompatible formats. |

CVV verification
----------------

Card Verification Value (CVV), also known as Card Security Code (CSC), or Card Verification Code (CVC), is a value or code that is used to verify the authenticity of card payments. If the CVV, CSC, or CVC code provided by the user does not match the code on record at the issuing bank, the payment may be declined to prevent fraud or unauthorized activity.

### How to get CVV result code

First, the cardholder's CVV needs to be collected. You can collect CVV by yourself and pass the information to Alipay through _paymentMethod.paymentMethodMetaData.cvv_ in the [**pay (Checkout Payment)**](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/payment_cashier) API, otherwise Alipay collects this information.

You can get the CVV/CSC/CVC result code through _paymentResultInfo.cvvResultRaw_ in the following APIs:

*   in the response body of the [**pay (Checkout Payment)**](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/payment_cashier) API
*   in the response body of the [**inquiryPayment**](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/paymentri_online) API
*   in the request body of the [**notifyPayment**](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/paymentrn_online) API

### CVV result codes



| **Result code** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Y | CVV matched. |
| D | CVV did not match. |
| P | CVV check was performed. |
| N | CVV should be on the card, but the merchant has indicated CVV is not present. |
| U | The issuing bank does not support CVV. |
| X | No CVV information is available. |
