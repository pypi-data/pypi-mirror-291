#### 3\. WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL DATA?

We share your personal data to complete the transaction you request, with card schemes, banks and other financial institutions. We also share your personal data with:

*   our affiliates and subsidiaries;
*   the relevant merchant (as described in section 2 above);
*   contractors, professional advisers and third party service providers who provide administrative, customer support, telecommunication, computing, remittance or other services to us in connection with the operation or maintenance of the PayFac Service; and
*   governmental departments, regulatory bodies, law enforcement/tax/customs agencies, courts of law or other third parties, for example, in respect of anti-money laundering, sanction screening and fraud or illegal activity prevention.

Please refer to the relevant merchant’s privacy notice for further information about how they share your personal data. **If you are located in the US,** all sharing of your personal data with third parties - other than regulators, our affiliates or vendors - are done pursuant to the instructions of the relevant merchant.

#### 4\. YOUR CHOICES AND PRIVACY RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO YOUR PERSONAL DATA

**If you are located in the US:** The relevant merchant from whom you make a purchase is the “controller” or “business” with regard to your personal data processed through the PayFac Services. They (rather than us) decide how and why your personal data is collected, used and shared, and how long it is retained. As a result, to make a request about your personal data, please contact the relevant merchant directly. If you send a request to us, we will forward that request to the relevant merchant and, where applicable, support them in meeting your request.

**If you are located in the EU or the UK:** You have certain rights in respect of your personal data as outlined below. If you would like to exercise any of the below rights then please contact Privacy-OpenPlatform@alipay.com and we will respond to your request. As necessary, we will ask you to provide proof of identity and to provide sufficient information to enable us to locate relevant personal data.

*   To ask for personal data that we hold about you to be corrected.
*   To ask us to erase your personal data if we no longer have a reason to hold it.
*   To ask us to restrict the processing of your personal data.
*   To ask for a copy of the personal data we hold about you.
*   To object to the processing of your personal data by us.

**If you are located in Singapore:** You have certain rights in respect of your personal data as outlined below. If you would like to exercise any of the below rights then please contact Privacy-OpenPlatform@alipay.com and we will respond to your request. As necessary, we will ask you to provide proof of identity and to provide sufficient information to enable us to locate relevant personal data.

*   To ask for personal data that we hold about you to be corrected.
*   To ask for a copy of the personal data we hold about you, and information about how that personal data has been used in the 12 months prior to the date of your request. As necessary, we may charge you a reasonable fee to respond to a request of this nature and we will provide you with a written estimate of any proposed fee.
*   To withdraw your consent to the processing of your personal data.

Please note that your privacy rights under applicable data protection laws are not absolute and are subject to certain exceptions and qualifications that mean they may not always apply.

#### 5\. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS OF PERSONAL DATA

Our operations are supported by a network of computers, servers and other infrastructure and information technology, including third party service providers – as identified in section 4 above. Some of these are established in countries outside of the European Economic Area (“**EEA**”), Singapore or the UK.

If you are located in the EEA/UK, your personal data identified in section 2 above is transferred outside of the EEA/UK as permitted by applicable data protection and privacy laws and regulations, including but not limited to the United States, China, and Singapore.

Ant Group has entered into standard contractual clauses (“**SCCs**”) for intra-group transfers of personal data. The categories of personal data processed by the data importers are set out in section 2 above. The data importers may also (onward) transfer personal data to third party recipients who may also be located outside the EEA/UK for the purposes set out in section 4 above. The data importers will only make such (onward) transfers to recipients ensuring appropriate safeguards are in place where required, or where otherwise permitted by the SCCs and which may include entry into SCCs.

Where we transfer personal data to other recipients located outside of the EEA/UK, we will always ensure that the recipient is based in a country with adequate data protection laws (e.g., Japan), that appropriate contractual obligations (e.g., SCCs) are implemented, that they otherwise adhere to Binding Corporate Rules, or that an appropriate derogation to legitimize the transfer can be relied on.

If you are located in Singapore, your personal data identified in section 2 above is transferred outside of Singapore as permitted by applicable data protection and privacy laws and regulations.

If you would like further information or a copy of the relevant contractual safeguards, you can contact us using the details set out in section 7 below.

#### 6\. HOW DO WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA?

We will only retain your personal data for as long as is necessary to provide our PayFac Services and will not hold or process your personal data for any longer than we are legally permitted to. The criteria used to determine the appropriate retention period includes:

*   Regulatory requirements we are subject to
*   Whether a legal claim could be brought against us
*   Necessity of information to provide our PayFac Services to the merchant
*   The types of personal data being processed
*   The legal basis for processing your personal data
