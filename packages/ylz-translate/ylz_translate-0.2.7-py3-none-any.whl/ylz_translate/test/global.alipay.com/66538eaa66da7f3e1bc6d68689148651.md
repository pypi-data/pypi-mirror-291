Transaction Items
=================

2023-05-25 06:43

The Transaction Items report is used by Alipay to provide merchants with all the successful transaction details on T day, and is generated on T + 1 day.

Report path and name
====================

The transaction details report is a text file encoded in UTF-8 and is uploaded to the agreed directory in SFTP for merchants to download and use. The file storage path defaults to `/v1/settlements/<merchantIdByAcquirer>/<transactionDate>/` plus the file name. The file name is `transactionItems_<transactionDate>_<seq>.csv`:

*   **merchantIdByAcquirer**: the identity assigned by Alipay for merchants.
*   **transactionDate**: the date of transaction.
*   **seq**: the file serial number.

The Transaction Items file is divided into two parts: the transaction details and file ending. The file ending <END> appears in the last line of the file as the file end flag.
