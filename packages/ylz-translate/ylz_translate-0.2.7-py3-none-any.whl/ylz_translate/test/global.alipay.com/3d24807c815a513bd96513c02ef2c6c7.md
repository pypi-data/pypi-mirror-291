Alipay is implementing a domain name upgrade for the cross-border payment solution. This upgrade involves changing the domain names for API calls and the SFTP server domain names.

As a merchant, it is important to update to the new domain names in preparation for the upgrade. This document provides the list of new domain names and detailed instructions for the transition.

> *   Optional: The original domain name remains usable after the domain name upgrade. However, it is recommended to switch to the new domain name for a better network connection.
> 
> *   Select the new domain name that you use according to your entity's registered location.
> *   Alipay Open Platform: Use these domain names to integrate with Alipay Open Platform APIs for cross-border services. If you have any questions, contact Alipay technical team.

> **Note**: In the pictures above, the new domain names are indicated in red.

### Schedule

The new domain names are already available and ready for use.

All original domain names that require mandatory switching will be discontinued as of June 30th, 2024 (in plan).

Key considerations
------------------

To facilitate a smooth switchover, you need to pay attention to the following information regarding the domain name switchover.

### Transit window

Start time: effective immediately.

Deadline: June 30, 2024.

> **Important**: The original domain names that are mandatory to switch from are planned to stop service on June 30th, 2024, which is the deadline for the switchover.

### Recommended preparations

Before switching to the new domain names, please take the following actions to ensure a seamless transition:

*   Perform connectivity, latency, and other tests on the new domain names to validate their functionality.
*   If needed, add the Alipay IP addresses to the allowlist as follows:



| Direction | Scenario | Recommended configuration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Merchant → Alipay | API call | If allowlisting is required, it is recommended to keep the existing allowlisted IP addresses and add the new IP addresses. For more information, see [Related IP addresses](#Rh1ls). |



*   For SFTP server domain name switchover:

*   Use your SFTP account and password, which will remain the same after the switchover, to log in to the new domain names to validate the account and password. It is not recommended to configure the SFTP server IP address allowlist.
*   If you have any questions about the transition process, please contact our support team. For more information, see the [Support](#nAU0x) section.
