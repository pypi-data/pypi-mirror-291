More information
----------------

About the _order_ field: Alipay does not verify the consistency of the amount in the _order_ field and the amount in the payment request. The order information is not applied in fund operations either. This field is mainly used for risk control, supervision, regulatory reporting, and consumption records display. Use the _env_ field if the risk control capability provided by Alipay is needed.

Sample for the order field

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

Result process logic
--------------------

For different request results, different actions need to be taken. See the following list for details:

*   `S`: When this value is returned, the API call succeeds.
*   `F`: When this value is returned, the API call fails. Take actions according to the corresponding result message or call the API again with a new _paymentRequestId_ value. If the issue persists, contact Alipay Technical Support.
*   `U`: When this value is returned, check the result code:

*   Result code is not `PAYMENT_IN_PROCESS`: The API call fails. Call this API again with a new _paymentRequestId value_.
*   Result code is `PAYMENT_IN_PROCESS`: Check whether one or more of the three URLs (appLinkUrl, normalUrl, schemeUrl) are returned:

*   one or more of the URLs returned: The transaction is created successfully. Redirect your user to the address specified by the URL to complete the payment.
*   no URLs returned: The transaction creation fails. Call the **pay** API again with a new _paymentRequestId_ value. If the issue persists, contact Alipay Technical Support.
