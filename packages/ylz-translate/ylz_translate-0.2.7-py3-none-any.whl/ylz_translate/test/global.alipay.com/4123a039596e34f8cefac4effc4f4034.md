This article introduces the integration solution to support accepting payments from a desktop browser or mobile browser. After integration, you can access various payment methods like digital wallets, bank cards, and bank transfers.

User experience
===============

The following screenshots show the user experience of wallet and bank transfer. During the first-time payments, buyers can enable password-free payment for subsequent payments. The entire payment process for subsequent payments will be performed on your website or application.

Wallet
------

With the entire payment process remaining within your website or application, buyers are allowed to pay and enable password-free payments during their first-time payments and make subsequent payments without the need to enter the payment password.

First-time payment

Subsequent payments

### First-time payment

During the first-time payment, the buyer completes the authorization process to pay and enable subsequent password-free payments.

### Subsequent payments

Subsequent payments can be made without the need for a password. For larger payment amounts, you can specify the minimum payment amount that requires an additional verification step for added security.

#### Small-value payment

For small-value orders, buyers can simply submit the order and make the payment without needing any further confirmation.

First-time payment
------------------

When a buyer selects a payment method provided by Antom, you need to collect essential information including the payment request ID, order amount, payment method, order description, payment redirect page URL, and payment result notification URL. Susequently, call the **createPaymentSession** API to place orders and call relevant methods in the Antom SDK to facilitate the payment process.

![Image 8: Easy Pay 首次支付流程图@3x.png](https://idocs-assets.marmot-cloud.com/storage/idocs87c36dc8dac653c1/1715417235698-b9af58be-a7da-4b19-8c7f-1d222fb83e93.png)

1.  **The** **buyer lands on the checkout page.**
2.  **Create the** [**createPaymentSession**](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/createpaymentsession_easypay) **request**  
    After the buyer selects a payment method and submits the order, you can obtain the payment session by calling the [**createPaymentSession**](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/createpaymentsession_easypay) interface.
3.  **Invoke the client SDK**  
    On the client side, invoke the SDK through the payment session. The SDK will collects payment elements, displays code information, redirects, invokes, and guides the buyer to complete the payment based on the payment method's characteristics.
4.  **Get th****e** **authorization** **result**

*   Asynchronous Notification: When the authorization is successful, Antom sends you the asynchronous notification through the [**notifyAuthorization**](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/notifyauth) API.
*   Synchronous Inquiry: Call the [**inquiryPayment**](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/paymentri_online) interface to check the authorization status.

5.  **Get the payment result**  
    Obtain the payment result by using one of the following two methods:

*   Asynchronous Notification: Specify the _paymentNotifyUrl_ in the [**createPaymentSession**](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/createpaymentsession_easypay) interface to set the address for receiving asynchronous notifications. When the payment is successful or expires, Antom will use [**notifyPayment**](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/paymentrn_online) to send asynchronous notifications to you.
*   Synchronous Inquiry: Call the [**inquiryPayment**](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/paymentri_online) interface to check the payment status.

Integration step
================

Start your integration by taking the following steps:

1.  Create a payment session
2.  Invoke the SDK
3.  Obtain authorization or payment result

Step 1: Create a payment session Server-side  

-----------------------------------------------

When a buyer selects a payment method provided by Antom, you need to collect essential information including the payment request ID, order amount, payment method, order description, payment redirect page URL, and payment result notification URL. Susequently, call the **createPaymentSession** API to create a payment session by completing these steps:

1.  Install an API library
2.  Initialize the request instance
3.  Call the **createPaymentSession** API

> **Note**: Antom provides server-side API libraries for multiple languages. The following codes use Java as an example. You need to install Java 6 or higher.

### Install an API library

You can find the latest version on [GitHub](https://github.com/alipay/global-open-sdk-java).

copy

    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.alipay.global.sdk</groupId>
      <artifactId>global-open-sdk-java</artifactId>
      <version>2.0.21</version>
    </dependency>

### Initialize the request instance

Create a singleton resource to make a request to Antom.

copy

    import com.alipay.global.api.AlipayClient;
    import com.alipay.global.api.DefaultAlipayClient;
    
    String merchantPrivateKey = "YOUR PRIVATE KEY";
    String alipayPublicKey = "ALIPAY PUBLIC KEY"
    AlipayClient defaultAlipayClient = new DefaultAlipayClient(EndPointConstants.SG,
                    merchantPrivateKey, alipayPublicKey);

### Call the createPaymentSession API

First-time payment

Subsequent payments

### FAQs

#### Can I use Chinese characters in the value of the request parameters?

To avoid incompatibility of a certain payment method, do not use Chinese characters for fields in the request, including _paymentRequestId_, _referenceOrderId_, _orderDescription_, and _goods._

#### How to set the URL to receive the payment notification?

Antom will send the payment result through the [**notifyPayment**](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/paymentrn_online), which you can specify in the **createPaymentSession** API via the _paymentNotifyUrl_ parameter. If the address of each payment is the same, you can also configure it in the Antom Dashboard. If you have configured the address and set the parameter in the API, Antom will use the address set in the API.

Step 2: Invoke the SDK Client-side
----------------------------------

### Install

Before beginning the integration, ensure that you have completed the following environment preparations:

*   Properly handle compatibility issues: Provide corresponding polyfills for Internet Explorer and other old browser versions. We recommend that you use [babel-preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env) to address browser compatibility issues when you build a project.
*   Use the following recommended browser versions:

*   For mobile browsers:

*   iOS 11 and later.
*   Android 5.0 and later.

*   For computer browsers, use the following recommended versions:

| **Parameter name** | **Required** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *enviroment* | ✅ | It is used to pass in environmental information. Valid values are:* `sandbox`: Sandbox environment * `prod`: Production environment |
| *locale* |  | It is used to pass in language information. Valid values are listed as follows. You can choose the value to pass based on the region of the payment method. If other values are passed, the local language is used by default:* `en_US`: English * `in_ID`: Indonesian * `th_TH`: Thai * `ms_MY`: Malay * `tl_PH`: Filipino * `ko_KR`: Korean * `vi_VN`: Vietnamese * `zh_HK`: Traditional Chinese |
| *analytics* |  | It is used to configure and analyze data. It contains a value below:* *enabled*: Optional Boolean. It defaults to true, which indicates that you allow the SDK to upload and analyze operational data to deliver a better service. If you do not allow the data to be uploaded and analyzed, specify it as `false`. |
| *onLog* |  | It is a callback method that is used to generate the error information about logs and API exceptions during the execution of the SDK. |
| *onEventCallback* |  | A callback function returns a specific event code when a payment event happens during SDK runtime, like payment result or a form submission error. For further information, please refer to the References. |



The following sample code shows how to obtain the browser language:

copy

    let language = navigator.language || navigator.userLanguage;
    language = language.replace("-", "_"); // Replace "-" with "_"

The following sample code shows how to instantiate the SDK by using npm:

copy

    import { AMSEasyPay } from '@alipay/ams-checkout' // Manage the package
    
    const checkoutApp = new AMSEasyPay({
      environment: "sandbox",
      locale: "en_US",
      analytics: {
        enabled: true
      },
      onLog: ({code, message})=>{},
      onClose:()=>{
        // Close the half-screen popup
      },
      onEventCallback: ({code, message})=>{},
    });

        // Close the half-screen popup
      },
      onEventCallback: ({code, message})=>{},
    });

### Invoke the SDK

Use the `createComponent` function in the instance object to create a payment component:



| **Parameter name** | **Required** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *sessionData* | ✅ | Create a configuration object by using the *sessionData* parameter: Pass the complete data in the *paymentSessionData* parameter obtained in the response through the **createpaymentSession (Checkout Payment)** API to the *sessionData* parameter. |
| *appearance* |  | Customized appearance theme configuration, and it contains the following child parameters:* *showLoading*: Optional. Boolean type. The default value is `true`, which shows the default loading animation. If you don't use the default loading animation, you need to specify this value as `false`. |



The following sample code shows how to render the component:

copy

    async function create(sessionData) {
      await checkoutApp.createComponent({ 
        sessionData: sessionData, 
        appearance:{
          showLoading: true, // Set as true by default to enable the default loading pattern.
        }
      });
    }

Call the `unmount` method to free SDK component resources in the following situations:

*   When the buyer switches views to exit the checkout page, free the component resources created in the **createPaymentSession**.
*   When the buyer initiates multiple payments, free the component resources created in the previous **createPaymentSession**.

copy

    // Free SDK component resources
    checkoutApp.unmount();

### FAQs

#### What can I do when I receive the `SDK_CREATEPAYMENT_PARAMETER_ERROR`?

When you receive this event code, please check if the sessionData passed in is correct and complete.

#### What can I do when I receive the `SDK_PAYMENT_ERROR` or Rendering View Error?

When you receive this event code, please check the network request. There may be an exception in the initialization interface, and you need to make sure that the environment of the payment session creation request is consistent with the environment parameters of the instantiated SDK. Check whether the payment session creation parameters are passed correctly. If the interface exception still exists, you can contact us for troubleshooting.

Step 3: Obtain authorization or payment result Server-side
----------------------------------------------------------

You can obtain the authorization and payment results for first-time payments, and a payment result only for subsequent payments. You can obtain the authorization or payment result by one of the following methods:

*   Receive the asynchronous notification
*   Inquire about the result

### **Receive the asynchronous notification**

Obtain the authorization result

Obtain the payment result

#### Obtain the authorization result

When the authorization is successful, Antom sends you the asynchronous notification through the [**notifyAuthorization**](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/notifyauth) API. When you receive the notification, you must return a response as instructed in [Requirements](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/paymentrn_online). Meanwhile, you must update the authorization status of the buyer in your system and display the buyer's desensitized account obtained from the notification on your authorization management page.

The following code shows a sample of the notification request:

copy

    {
      "accessToken": "2810123456789012345678901234567890",
      "authState": "AUTHSTATE_SAMPLE_1234567890",
      "authorizationNotifyType": "TOKEN_CREATED",
      "userLoginId": "852-52***184",
      "result": {
        "resultCode": "SUCCESS",
        "resultMessage": "success.",
        "resultStatus": "S"
      }
    }

The following sample code shows how to verify the signature of the notification and make a response to the notification:

copy

    @RequestMapping(path = "/authResult", method = RequestMethod.POST)
    public ResponseEntity<AlipayResponse> authNotifyProcessor(HttpServletRequest request,
                                                              @RequestBody String body) {
        // retrieve the required parameters from the request header.
        String requestTime = request.getHeader("request-time");
        String clientId = request.getHeader("client-id");
        String rawSignature = request.getHeader("signature");
        String signature = "";
    
        // get valid part from raw signature
        if(rawSignature==null||rawSignature.isEmpty()){
            throw new RuntimeException("empty notify signature");
        }else {
            String[] parts = rawSignature.split("signature=");
            if (parts.length > 1) {
                signature = parts[1];
            }
        }
    
        // verify auth result notify's signature
        boolean verifyResult = SignatureTool.verify(request.getMethod(), request.getRequestURI(),
                clientId, requestTime, body, signature,
                ALIPAY_PUBLIC_KEY);
        if (!verifyResult) {
            throw new RuntimeException("Invalid notify signature");
        }
    
        // update the record status with notify result
    
        // respond the server that we accept the notify
        Result result = new Result("SUCCESS", "success", ResultStatusType.S);
        AlipayResponse response = new AlipayResponse();
        response.setResult(result);
        return ResponseEntity.ok().body(response);
    }

#### Obtain the payment result

When the payment reaches a final status of success or failure, Antom sends an asynchronous notification to the _paymentNotifyUrl_ specified in the **createPaymentSession** API through the [**notifyPayment**](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/paymentrn_online) API. When you receive the notification from Antom, you are required to return a response as instructed in [Requirements](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/cashier_payment_cn/notification).

Antom allows you to specify the URL in the _paymentNotifyUrl_ parameter within the **createPaymentSession** API. If the URL for each payment is the same, you can also configure it in the Antom Dashboard.

The following code shows a sample of the notification request:

copy

    {
      "notifyType": "PAYMENT_RESULT",
      "result": {
        "resultCode": "SUCCESS",
        "resultStatus": "S",
        "resultMessage": "success"
      },
      "paymentRequestId": "2020010123456789XXXX",
      "paymentId": "2020010123456789XXXX",
      "paymentAmount": {
        "value": "4200",
        "currency": "SGD"
      },
      "paymentCreateTime": "2020-01-01T12:01:00+08:30",
      "paymentTime": "2020-01-01T12:01:01+08:30"
    }

The following sample code shows how to verify the signature of the notification and make a response to the notification:

copy

    @RequestMapping(path = "/payResult", method = RequestMethod.POST)
    public ResponseEntity<AlipayResponse> paymentNotifyProcessor(HttpServletRequest request,
                                                                 @RequestBody String body) {
    
        // retrieve the required parameters from the request header.
        String requestTime = request.getHeader("request-time");
        String clientId = request.getHeader("client-id");
        String rawSignature = request.getHeader("signature");
        String signature = "";
    
        // get valid part from raw signature
        if(rawSignature==null||rawSignature.isEmpty()){
            throw new RuntimeException("empty notify signature");
        }else {
            String[] parts = rawSignature.split("signature=");
            if (parts.length > 1) {
                signature = parts[1];
            }
        }
    
        // verify payment result notify's signature
        boolean verifyResult = SignatureTool.verify(request.getMethod(), request.getRequestURI(),
                clientId, requestTime, body, signature,
                ALIPAY_PUBLIC_KEY);
        if (!verifyResult) {
            throw new RuntimeException("Invalid notify signature");
        }
    
        // update the record status with notify result
    
        // respond the server that we accept the notify
        Result result = new Result("SUCCESS", "success", ResultStatusType.S);
        AlipayResponse response = new AlipayResponse();
        response.setResult(result);
        return ResponseEntity.ok().body(response);
    }

#### FAQs

##### When will the notification be sent?

It depends on whether the payment is completed:

*   If the payment is successfully completed, Antom will usually send you an asynchronous notification within 3 to 5 seconds. For some payment methods like OTC, the notification might take a bit longer.
*   If the payment is not completed, Antom needs to close the order first before sending an asynchronous notification. The time it takes for different payment methods to close the order varies, usually defaulting to 14 minutes.

##### Will the asynchronous notification be re-sent?

If you receive an asynchronous notification from Antom, you are required to return the response in the [Sample code](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/cashier_payment_cn/notification) format. If you do not respond to the asynchronous notification as required, or the asynchronous notification is not delivered due to network reasons, the notification will be automatically resent within 24 hours. The notification can be resent up to 8 times or until a correct response is received to terminate delivery. The sending intervals are as follows: 0 minutes, 2 minutes, 10 minutes, 10 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 6 hours, and 15 hours.

#### When responding to the authorization notification, do I need to add a digital signature?

If you receive an asynchronous notification from Antom, you need to make a response in the [Sample code](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/cashier_payment_cn/notification) format, but there is no need to add a signature.

#### What are the key parameters in the authorization notification that I need to use?

Pay attention to these key parameters in the notification:

*   _result_: represents the payment result of the order.
*   _authState_: the vaulting request ID generated by the merchant.
*   _accessToken_: the auto debit ID generated by Antom used for subsequent payment.
*   _userLoginId_: the user's desensitized account number.

#### What are the key parameters in the payment notification that I need to use?

Pay attention to these key parameters in the notification:

*   _result_: the payment result of the order.
*   _paymentRequestId_: the payment request ID generated by the merchant used for querying, canceling, and reconciliation.
*   _paymentId_: the payment order ID generated by Antom used for refund and reconciliation.
*   _paymentAmount_: if there is a need for amount reconciliation, you can consume this field.

### Inquire about the result

You can call the **inquiryPayment** API to initiate a query on the result of an order.



| **Parameter name** | **Required** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *paymentRequestId* |  | The payment request ID generated by you. |



The parameter is not a full set of parameters, please refer to the [**inquiryPayment**](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/paymentri_online) API for full set of parameters and additional requirements for certain payment methods.

The following sample code shows how to call the **inquiryPayment** API:

copy

    
    AlipayClient defaultAlipayClient = new DefaultAlipayClient(EndPointConstants.SG,
                    merchantPrivateKey, alipayPublicKey);
    
    AlipayPayQueryRequest alipayPayQueryRequest = new AlipayPayQueryRequest();
    alipayPayQueryRequest.setClientId(CLIENT_ID);
    alipayPayQueryRequest.setPath("/ams/sandbox/api/v1/payments/inquiryPayment");
    
    AlipayPayQueryResponse alipayPayQueryResponse;
        try {
            alipayPayQueryResponse = defaultAlipayClient.execute(alipayPayQueryRequest);
        } catch (AlipayApiException e) {
           String errorMsg = e.getMessage();
                // handle error condition
        }

The following code shows a sample of the request message:

copy

    {
      "paymentRequestId": "2019060811401080010018882020035****"
    }

The following code shows a sample of the response message:

copy

    {
      "result": {
        "resultCode": "SUCCESS",
        "resultStatus": "S",
        "resultMessage": "Success"
      },
      "paymentStatus": "SUCCESS",
      "paymentRequestId": "pay_1089760038715669_10277574507XXXX",
      "paymentId": "2019060811401080010018882020035XXXX",
      "paymentAmount": {
        "value": "4200",
        "currency": "SGD"
      },
      "paymentCreateTime": "2019-06-01T12:01:01+08:30",
      "paymentTime": "2019-06-01T12:01:01+08:30",
      "transactions": null
    }

#### FAQs

##### How often should I call the inquiryPayment API?

It is recommended to initiate a round-robin query at an interval of 2 seconds until either the final payment result is retrieved or an asynchronous payment notification is received.

##### What are the key parameters in the notification that I need to use?

Pay attention to these key parameters:

*   _result_: Represents the result of this **inquiryPayment** API call, the result of the order needs to be judged according to _paymentStatus_, `SUCCESS` and `FAIL` represent the final result, `PROCESSING` represents the processing.
*   _paymentAmount_: Indicates the payment amount.

Sample codes  

===============

**Full sample codes for front-end:**

copy

    // Step 1: Instantiate the SDK
    const checkoutApp = new window.AMSCashierPayment({
      environment: "sandbox",
      locale: "en_US",
      onLog: ({code, message}) => {},
      onEventCallback: ({code, message}) => {},
    });
    
    // Handle payment button events.
    document
      .querySelector("#your form id")
      .addEventListener("submit", handleSubmit);
    
    async function handleSubmit() {
      // Step 2: The server calls createPaymentSession API to obtain paymentSessionData.
      async function getPaymentSessionData() {
        const url = "Fill in the server address";
        const config = {
          // Fill in the request configuration.
        };
        const response = await fetch(url, config);
        // Obtain the value of the paymentSessionData parameter in the response.
        const { paymentSessionData } = await response.json();
        return paymentSessionData;
      }
      const paymentSessionData = await getPaymentSessionData();
    
      // Step 3: Create rendering components.
      await checkoutApp.createComponent({ 
        sessionData: paymentSessionData, 
        appearance:{
          showLoading: true, // Default is true to allow the configuration whether to display a loading animation.
        }, 
      });
    }

**Sample codes for** **customized loading animation**

The card payment scenario supports configuration of custom loading animations:

1.  Configure _showLoading_ to `false` when rendering the component.
2.  Render a customized loading animation on the current page when the createComponent function is called.
3.  Listen to the onEventCallback event.

1.  Show your custom loading animation when you receive the `SDK_START_OF_LOADING` event code.
2.  End your custom loading animation when you receive the `SDK_END_OF_LOADING` event code.

copy

    async function create(sessionData) {
      await checkoutApp.createComponent({ 
        sessionData: sessionData, 
        appearance:{
          showLoading: false, // Default is true to allow the configuration whether to display a loading animation.
        }, 
      });
    }
    

Event codes  

==============

You might see two types of event codes:

*   Status codes: Returned by `onEventCallback` during the component's runtime lifecycle.
*   Error codes: Returned by `onEventCallback` or `onError` during the component initialization phase.



| **Type** | **Code** | **Description** | **Further action** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Status codes | SDK\_START\_OF\_LOADING | The loading animation starts to be shown when the component is created. When configured to hide loading and use a custom animation, the custom animation can be rendered at this time. | No further action. |
| SDK\_END\_OF\_LOADING | The loading animation ends when the component is created. When configured to hide loading and use custom animation, the animation can be hidden at this time. | No further action. |
| SDK\_CALL\_URL\_ERROR | * This event code represents one of the following situations in the event information: + Failed to redirect to merchant page. + Failed to redirect to the 3D challenge page. + The *paymentRedirectUrl* parameter is not specified or is not correctly specified when calling the **createPaymentSession** request.  In the Web or WAP scenario, redirecting links is usually not abnormal. It is recommended that you verify the redirected link. In the app scenario, if this exception frequently occurs, contact Antom Technical Support to troubleshoot redirection or calling issues. | No further action. |
| Error codes | SDK\_INTERNAL\_ERROR | SDK internal error. | Contact Antom Technical Support. |
| SDK\_CREATEPAYMENT\_PARAMETER\_ERROR | `mountComponent` method specified parameter abnormally. | Check if the parameters are correct and reinitialize the component. |
| SDK\_INIT\_PARAMETER\_ERROR | `AMSEasyPay` method specified parameter abnormally. | Check if the parameters are correct and re-instantiate the SDK. |
| SDK\_CREATECOMPONENT\_ERROR | Component initialization exception. | Contact Antom Technical Support. |
| SDK\_SUBMIT\_NETWORK\_ERROR | Interface call failed due to network reasons. It may occur in submit method submission. | Try to submit it again. |
