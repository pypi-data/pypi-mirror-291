Settlement Items
================

2023-05-25 06:43

The settlement Items report is used by Alipay to provide merchants with settlement details in a settlement cycle.

Report path and name
====================

The settlement details report is a text file with UTF-8 code and is uploaded to a specified directory in SFTP for merchants to download and use. The file storage path defaults to `/v1/settlements/<merchantIdByAcquirer>/<settlementDate>/` plus report name. The report name differs for each settlement mode:

**Settlement by** **multiple payment methods:**

The report name is `settlementItems_<settlementCurrency>_<settlementBatchId>_<seq>.csv`.

**Settlement by single payment method:**

The report name is different for Alipay+ MPPs and other payment methods.

*   For Alipay+ MPPs:

*   When Alipay+ MPPs are settled together: `settlementItems_CONNECTWALLET_<settlementCurrency>_<settlementBatchId>_<seq>.csv`
*   When Alipay+ MPPs are settled individually: `settlementItems_<pspName>_<settlementCurrency>_<settlementBatchId>_<seq>.csv`

*   For other payment methods: `settlementItems_<paymentMethodType>_<settlementCurrency>_<settlementBatchId>_<seq>.csv`

Details about the variables in the report name:

*   **merchantIdByAcquirer**: the unique ID that is assigned by Alipay to identify a merchant.
*   **settlementDate**: the settlement date.
*   **pspName**: the name of the actual Alipay+ Mobile Payment Provider, such as GCash.
*   **settlementCurrency**: the agreed settlement currency, which is the same as the settlement currency in the file content.
*   **settlementBatchId**: the settlement batch code corresponds to the settlement batch number in the Summary Files.
*   **seq**: the document serial number.

Report fields
=============

The Settlement Items report is divided into two parts: settlement details and file endings. The report ends with a symbol of <END>, which appears in the last line of the report as the file end flag.

    <END>

### Sample 3

Assume that the settlement is T+4 and no transaction exists on December 22, 2018. The settlement date is December 26, 2018. On December 26, 2018, an empty CSV file with the file name of `settlementItems_KaKaoPay_USD_0000000000000000000_000.cs` is generated by Alipay.

The settlement details are as follows:

copy

    settlementBatchId,acquirer,customerId,acquirerReferenceNo,referenceMerchantId,referenceStoreId,transactionId,originalTransactionId,transactionRequestId,referenceTransactionId,paymentMethodType,pspName,transactionType,paymentTime,settlementTime,productCode,transactionAmountValue,transactionCurrency,settlementAmountValue,settlementCurrency,quoteCurrencyPair,quotePrice,feeAmountValue,feeCurrency,processingFeeAmountValue,processingFeeCurrency,nonGuaranteeCouponValue,nonGuaranteeCouponCurrency,originalTransactionRequestId,disputeHandlingFee,disputeHandlingFeeCurrency,disputeReverseFee,disputeReverseFeeCurrency,installmentNum,issuingCountry,cardBrand,funding,interchangeFeeAmountValue,interchangeFeeCurrency,schemeFeeAmountValue,schemeFeeCurrency,acquirerMarkupAmountValue,acquirerMarkupCurrency
    <END>

### Sample 4

When the acquirer is Hundsun, Alipay will calculate the settlement data of each transaction for merchants, because Hundsun only provides the total settlement data. The total settlement data calculated by Alipay and Hundsun may be different, so Alipay provides the error correction information about the amount calculation differences. For example:

*   If the total _settlementAmountValue_ values calculated by Hundsun and Alipay are respectively `37164` and `37140`, the error correction information for _settlementAmountValue_ is `24`.
*   If the total _feeAmountValue_ values calculated by Hundsun and Alipay are respectively `760` and `760`, the error correction information for _feeAmountValue_ is `0`.
*   If the total _taxFeeAmountValue_ values calculated by Hundsun and Alipay are respectively `76` and `100`, the error correction information for _taxFeeAmountValue_ is `-24`.

> **Note**:
> 
> *   The merchant settles with the final settlement amount of Hundsun.
> *   The error correction information is on the second-to-last line of settlement files.

On October 17, 2022, a merchant has three transactions, two for payments and one for a refund. The merchant's acquirer is Hundsun. On the settlement date of October 19, 2022, a CSV file with the file name `settlementItems_PAYPAY_JPY_2022101909031102123_000.csv` is generated by Alipay.

### Sample 5

Interchange++ is a pricing model that consists of the fees charged by the relevant issuing bank, card scheme, and acquirer for processing every transaction. This pricing model is transparent because it offers the most detailed breakdown of the true costs. The interchange++ pricing model includes the following three types of fees:

*   **Interchange fee**: The fee that is charged by the issuing bank.
*   **Scheme fee** (first+): The fee that is charged by the card scheme.
*   **Acquirer fee** (second+): The fee that is charged by the acquirer.

When the acquirer is 2C2P and the interchange++ pricing model is used, the settlement reports may have error correction information. The error correction information represents the discrepancy between the fee that should be charged and the fee that is actually charged, and is presented on the second-to-last line through the _feeAmountValue_ field of the settlement reports.

*   If the value of _feeAmountValue_ is positive, it means the fee that should be charged is less than the fee that is actually charged, and the acquirer needs to pay you the discrepancy fee.
*   If the value of _feeAmountValue_ is negative, it means the fee that should be charged is greater than the fee that is actually charged, and you need to pay the acquirer the discrepancy fee.

The acquirer sends the error correction information to Alipay irregularly. Alipay sends you the error correction information through the settlement reports.

For example, the following settlement items report has two transactions that happened on January 6, 2023. The report contains extra error correction information presented on the second-to-last line of the report.

Pay attention to the following information:

*   **feeAmountValue** (_summaryType_ = `default`): -500
*   **feeCurrency** (_summaryType_ = `default`): SGD

In the preceding report, the value of _feeAmountValue_ is negative and the fee currency is SGD. This means that you need to pay the acquirer 500 SGD extra.

> **Note:** In the same batch, the error correction information returned by the settlement detail report and the settlement summary report is the same.
