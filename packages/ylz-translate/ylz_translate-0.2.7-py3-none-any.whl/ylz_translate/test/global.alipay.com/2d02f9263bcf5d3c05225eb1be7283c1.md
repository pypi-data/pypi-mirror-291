Secure file transmission
========================

2022-03-03 08:49

Fulfill these security requirements to ensure secure file transmission.

SFTP account management 
========================

If the SFTP server of Alipay is used, contact technical support to obtain the credentials to log in to the SFTP server.

If the SFTP server of a partner is used, partners must complete the SFTP server system configuration on Alipay first.

File transfer process 
======================

File exchange happens between Alipay and partners.

For the file sender, the file uploading process is as follows:

Pre-upload process 
-------------------

Before the transmission, encrypt files by using the PGP algorithm to enhance transmission security. A .asc suffix is added to the encrypted file to differentiate it from the unencrypted file.

Upload files 
-------------

To prevent temporary files from being wrongly downloaded, rename the file by appending a .tmp suffix to the file name before uploading. After the transmission is completed, rename the file back to the original name by removing the .tmp suffix.

Download files 
---------------

Do not download the temporary file, which has a .tmp suffix.

After the file is downloaded, decrypt the file by using the PGP algorithm.

File retention 
---------------

Files on the SFTP server can be kept for seven days. Files older than seven days are automatically removed from the server.
