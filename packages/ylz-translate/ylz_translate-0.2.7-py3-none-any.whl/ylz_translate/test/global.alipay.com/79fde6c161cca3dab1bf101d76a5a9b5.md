If you have integrated with the New Transaction QR Code Payment product, see [Order Code Payment](https://global.alipay.com/doc/ams_oc/introduction) for details.

Overview
--------

The Transaction QR Code Payment solution is making use of the dynamically produced QR code to represent a transaction. In this payment solution, the customer does not need to input the transaction amount, but scan the generated QR code to complete the payment.

To provide such a payment service, the merchant needs to integrate with Alipay system through the interfaces that have been developed for this product.

Target audience

**QR code**

Quick Response Code (QR Code) consists of black squares arranged in a square grid on a white background, which can be read by an imaging device and processed. The required data are then extracted from patterns that are present in both horizontal and vertical components of the image, as depicted below.

In this Transaction QR Code payment solution, the merchant system will send a request to the Alipay system with the transaction data, and the Alipay will respond a QR Code to represent the transaction.

**Interface**

In this context, the interface is the channel that the Alipay system provides the relevant service by invoking the corresponding APIs with the required parameter values. Throughout this guide, we may use interface and serive interchangeably.
