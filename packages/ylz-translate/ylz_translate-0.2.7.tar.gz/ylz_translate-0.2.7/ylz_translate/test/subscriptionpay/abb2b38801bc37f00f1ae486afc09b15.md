Cancel subscription or refund
=============================

Cancel subscription
===================

Call the [**cancel**](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/cancel_sub) API in one of the following cases:

*   If the buyer does not want to continue the service in the future
*   If the merchant wants to terminate the service proactively due to payment failure

After calling the [**cancel**](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/cancel_sub) API successfully, the unpaid billing plans in the subscription period table will not take effect. You can check the cancellation type by using the value of the cancelRequestType parameter:



| **Reason for subscription cancellation** | `cancelRequestType` |
| --- | --- |
| Buyer initiates cancellation of subscription | `CANCEL` |
| Merchant cancels subscription proactively due to payment failure | `CANCEL` |
| Subscription is canceled and refunded due to buyer complaint | `TERMINATED` |



After the subscription is canceled, Antom sends an asynchronous notification to you.

Refund
======

If the subscription cancellation involves a refund (such as in the case of a buyer complaint that leads to refund), you can call the [**refund**](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/refund_online) API.

About refunds:



| **Capabilities** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Refund period** | Within 12 months after the transaction is completed. |
| **Handling fee refunded or not** | Whether the handling fee is to be refunded or not depends on the contract. |
| **Partial refunds** | Partial refunds are allowed. |
| **Multiple refunds** | Multiple refunds are allowed. |
| **Exchange rate for refund** | If cross-currency settlement is involved, the Alipay exchange rate of the day following the refund request will be used.If the settlement currency is used for the pricing currency, there is no need for exchange rate conversion. |



Antom does not send asynchronous notifications after a successful refund. For details, refer to the **refund** API or check the [**inquiryRefund**](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/ir_online) API to confirm the refund result.
