revoke
======

POST /v1/authorizations/revoke

Use this API to cancel a user's authorization to a merchant. The access token becomes invalid after Alipay receives the revoke request, and the merchant can no longer access the user resource scope with the access token. In addition, the merchant cannot use the related refresh token to obtain a new access token.

Structure
=========

A message consists of a header and body. The following sections are focused on the body structure. For the header structure, see：

*   [Request header](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/api_fund#ML5ur) 
*   [Response header](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/api_fund#WWH90) 

**Note**: Set the data type of each field (except array) as String. This means that you must use double quotation marks (" ") to enclose the field value. Examples:

If the data type of a field is Integer and its value is 20, set it as "20".

If the data type of a field is Boolean and its value is `true`, set it as "true".

Result process logic
--------------------

For different request results, different actions are to be performed. See the following list for details:

*   If the value of _result.resultStatus_ is `S`, the authorization is successfully canceled. The access token cannot be used to access the user's resources anymore. In addition, the relative _refreshToken_ cannot be used to update _accessToken_ anymore_._
*   If the value of _result.resultStatus_ is `F`, system defects or system failure occurred. It is suggested to check the system manually and take actions according to the result code.
*   If the value of _result.resultStatus_ is `U`, the call status of this API is unknown. Retry the process by calling this API again.
