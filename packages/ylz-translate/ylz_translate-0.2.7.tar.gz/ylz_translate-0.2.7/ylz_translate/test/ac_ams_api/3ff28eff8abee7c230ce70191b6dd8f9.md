notifyCapture (Checkout Payment)
================================

2024-04-24 07:15

The **notifyCapture** API is used by Alipay to send the capture result to the merchant when the capture processing reaches a final state of success or failure.

Structure
=========

A message consists of a header and body. The following sections are focused on the body structure. For the header structure, see：

*   [Request header](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/api_fund#ML5ur)
*   [Response header](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/api_fund#WWH90)

**Note**: Set the data type of each field (except array) as String. This means that you must use double quotation marks (" ") to enclose the field value. Examples:

*   If the data type of a field is Integer and its value is 20, set it as "20". 
*   If the data type of a field is Boolean and its value is `true`, set it as "true".
