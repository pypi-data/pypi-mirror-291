More information 
-----------------

This section gives additional information about other parameters. See the following parameters for details:

**•** _productCode_:  
The value of this parameter is the payment product that the merchant uses for collecting payments, based on the contract between the merchant and Alipay. When the merchant can use multiple products, this parameter is required.

**•** _order_:  
The _order_ parameter contains order information, such as Merchant, Goods, logistic, and purchase environment. During the payment process, the order information is mainly used by Alipay for risk control or anti-money laundering. After the payment is completed, the information is used to display consumption records, regulatory reporting, and other purposes. However, Alipay does not verify the consistency of the amount in _order_ and the amount in the payment request. The order information is not applied in fund operations either. Use the _env_ field if the risk control capability provided by Alipay is needed.  
In this case, _order.merchant.referenceMechantId_, _order.merchant.merchantMCC_, _order.merchant.store.referenceStoreId_, and _order.merchant.store.storeMcc_ are mandatory. It is recommended to specify _order.env.storeTerminalRequestTime_ and _order.env.storeTerminalId_**.**

Sample for the order field

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

**•** _paymentMethod:_  
The value of _paymentMethod_ is `CONNECT_WALLET`, indicating that Alipay collects money from the user's payment code that was generated by Alipay.

**•** _paymentMethodId_:  
The unique identifier of the user's payment asset, which can be obtained by using the [**applyToken**](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/accesstokenapp) interface. For User-Presented Mode payments, this field is required and can be used by the merchant to decide which payment service should be called to process the payment. See [Payment Code Specification](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/upm#Cy5K6) for more information.

**•** _paymentExpiryTime_:  
The payment executor must ensure that the payment will not succeed after the expiration time. If this parameter is not specified in the request, the expiration time is then decided by the payment executor.

**•** _paymentFactor_:  
The value of _paymentFactor.inStorePaymentScenario_ is `PaymentCode`, indicating that the payment code is used for payment.

### Payment code specifications

An Alipay payment code is a number that is between 16 to 24 digits and starts with a number ranging from 25 to 30.

For user-presented code payments, use the following rules to determine which payment service is to be called：

*   If an Alipay payment code is used for payment, the merchant needs to route the payment to Alipay.
*   If a non-Alipay payment code is used for payment, the merchant needs to route the payment to the corresponding payment provider of the non-Alipay payment code.
*   If a merchant that is integrated with Alipay has integrated with other local wallets that provide payment codes conforming to Alipay payment code rule, for example, the Macao Wallet, or the PayPay wallet, the merchant needs to route the payment to the local wallet system when payment codes from such local wallets are used, or to route the payment to Alipay when Alipay payment codes are used. To determine the payment code belongs to Alipay or the local wallet, use the following rules: 

**Asia**



| **Payment code rule** | | | **Payment service** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Length** | **First two digits** | **Special rule** |
| 24 | 25 - 30 | The fourth, fifth, and sixth digits are 8, 0, and 1. | PayPay |
| 16~24 | 25 - 30 | / | Alipay |





| **Payment code rule** | | | **Payment service** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Length** | **First two digits** | **Special rule** |
| 16~24 | 25 - 30 | The fourth, fifth, and sixth digits are 0, 0, and 3. | Macao Wallet |
| 16~24 | 25 - 30 | / | Alipay |





| **Payment code rule** | | | **PaymentService** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Length** | **First two digits** | **Special rule** |
| 16~24 | 25 - 30 | - | Alipay |





| **Payment code rule** | | | **PaymentService** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Length** | **First two digits** | **Special rule** |
| 16~24 | 25 - 30 | - | Alipay |



Result process logic
--------------------

After calling a **pay** interface, the following results might be returned from Alipay or no result is received by the merchant:

*   Alipay returns that _result.resultStatus_ is `S`, which indicates the transaction succeeds and the money is deducted successfully.
*   Alipay returns that _result.resultStatus_ is `F`, the merchant needs to take further actions according to the error message in _result.resultCode_.
*   Alipay returns that _result.resultStatus_ is `U`, the merchant needs to use the **inquiryPayment** interface to inquire the payment result. The inquiry request can be sent 10 to 20 times, with an interval of 3 seconds.
*   If no asynchronous notification and payment result are returned from Alipay within 5 seconds after the payment request is sent, the merchant needs to use the **inquiryPayment** interface to inquire the payment result. The inquiry request can be sent 10 to 20 times, with an interval of 3 seconds.
*   When calling the **inquiryPayment** interfaces, if no payment result can be obtained after the inquiry requests being sent more than the maximum number of times, the merchant needs to call the **cancel** interface to cancel the transaction. If being out of the cancellable period, the merchant cannot use the **cancel** interface to cancel the transaction. The merchant can call the **refund** interface to make a refund instead.
