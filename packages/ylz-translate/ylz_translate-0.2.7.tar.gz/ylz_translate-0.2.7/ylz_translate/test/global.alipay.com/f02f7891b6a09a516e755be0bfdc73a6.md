Solution benefits
-----------------

With Alipay enabled, merchants can improve checkout efficiency, reduce cash management cost, and facilitate easy communication between customers and cashiers.

Compared with traditional cash or cards methods, less time is required for payment processing when cashier scan to collect. Therefore, the queueing time is reduced (where applicable), and checkout efficiency is improved. The following figure illustrates how accepting Alipay payment improves efficiency:



| **Efficiency metric** | **Type of merchant** | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Does not accept Alipay** | **Accepts Alipay** |
| Cost of cash management | High | Low |
| Check out efficiency | 1 min per order | 10 sec per order |
| Employee number | 1 p/ECR | 0.2 p/ECR (ummaned self-checkout) |



**Facilitate easy communication**

Customers can pay in their language and currency to reduce language or cultural barriers, and therefore enhance the overall purchasing experience.

**Reduce cash management cost**

With this cashless payment method enabled, merchants no longer need to collect, transport, or store the cash. In addition, Alipay provides direct settlement to merchants bank account and regular reconciliation, minimizing the management cost of cashier and backend operation.
