Auto debit enables the online automatic deduction feature on your websites or applications and supports deployment on multiple client types (Web, WAP, App). A one-time authorization enables you to conduct future payments with one click. You only need to integrate once to enjoy multiple payment methods, such as digital wallets and bank transfers. The excellent seamless payment experience reduces customer loss caused by deduction failures. Accepting multiple payment methods also helps you grow and expand your business.

Capabilities
============

Authorization

Payment

After the payment

### Authorization

*   **Obtain the authorization**:

*   **Enable available payment methods**: Sign the contract to support desired payment methods.
*   **Obtain the authorization**: Obtain the URL that is used to render the authorization page using the [**consult**](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/authconsult) API, and display the payment method authorization page to the buyer. We recommend that you dynamically render the supported payment methods on the payment method authorization page based on the buyer's region.
*   **Obtain the authorization result**: If you have configured the address to receive authorization result notifications, you will receive an [**authorization success notification**](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/notifyauth) from Antom after the buyer's authorization is obtained.
*   **Obtain a payment token**: After the buyer agrees to authorize the Auto Debit service for the payment method, you can obtain the payment token through the [**applyToken**](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/accesstokenapp) API. Furthermore, you can update the payment token through the [**applyToken**](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/accesstokenapp) API when the payment token is about to expire.

*   **Cancel the authorization**:

*   If the buyer cancels the authorization within your client, you need to invalidate the payment token for the payment method through the [**revoke**](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/authrevocation) API.
*   If the buyer cancels the authorization within the payment method client, you will receive an [authorization cancellation notification](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/notifyauth).

### Payment

*   **Initiate a payment**: After the buyer submits the order and clicks **Confirm Payment**, your client calls the [**pay**](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/payment_agreement) API to send a payment request to the Antom server, and the deduction is completed upon successful request processing.
*   **Obtain the payment result**:

*   **Synchronous redirection**: After completing the payment, the buyer will be redirected to the payment result page that you specify through _authRedirectUrl_ in the [**consult**](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/authconsult) API.
*   **Asynchronous notification**: After you set the asynchronous notification address through _paymentNotifyUrl_ in the [**pay**](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/payment_agreement) API, Antom will send asynchronous notifications to the address when the payment is completed or when the payment is expired.
*   **Active inquiry**: Inquire about the transaction status through the [**inquiryPayment**](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/paymentri_online) API.

### After the payment

*   **Refund a payment**: You can initiate a refund on [Antom Merchant Portal](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/cashier_payment_cn/refund#Ote0I) or by using the [**refund**](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/refund_online) API. Antom uses the [**notifyRefund**](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/notify_refund) notification to send you the refund result. You can also call the [**inquiryRefund**](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/ir_online) API to inquire about the refund result.
*   **Cancel a transaction**: You can call the [**cancel**](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/paymentc_online) API to cancel a transaction.
*   [**Settle and reconcile**](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/reconcile/perform): You can use the settlement files provided by Antom for reconciliation purposes.
