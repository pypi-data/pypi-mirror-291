Overview
========

The barcode payment solution provides the way to pay for an order by scanning the barcode on customer's phone. This guide specifies the steps to integrate the merchant's system with Alipay to achieve the goal. To follow the tasks and steps outlined in this guide, you need to have:

*   XML programming skills
*   Knowledge of HTTPS
*   Some knowledge of how to use Alipay payment services
*   Access to the relevant Alipay API library entitled Alipay Spot Payment with barcode API Specification (2015) 

The relevant Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for the solution described in this guide are located at:

*   [Payment interface](https://global.alipay.com/doc/global/spot_pay) alipay.acquire.overseas.spot.pay
*   [Cancel interface](https://global.alipay.com/doc/global/acquire_cancel) alipay.acquire.cancel
*   [Query interface](https://global.alipay.com/doc/global/overseas_query) alipay.acquire.overseas.query
*   [Refund interface](https://global.alipay.com/doc/global/spot_refund) alipay.acquire.overseas.spot.refund

Terms
=====

*   **Customer** - The Alipay user purchasing from the merchant in store or face to face are non-local users of the Alipay wallet app, i.e. cross-border customers.
*   **Merchant** \- The business that offers Alipay as a payment method to its customers. Face to face merchant may scan the customer's QR code/Barcode or display their own QR code instead of having to pay by cash or card. This guide describes the case where merchants scan the customer's QR code/Barcode.
*   **Scanning** - The act of capturing the user's payment information via camera or laser scanner in the scenarios where a merchant scans the Alipay wallet app. Examples of hardware usage for scanning: a laser gun, a mobile device with app, or an mPOS terminal with camera.
*   **QR code/Barcode** - A representation of the user's or merchant's identity which is unique and fixed, and allows the merchant to scan. The customer presents the screen of their own Alipay app, where the info is displayed simultaneously in a barcode format (top of screen) & a QR code format (rest of screen).
*   **System Integrator** - Provides technical solutions to merchants to accept Alipay but has no payment liability.
*   **Acquirer** - Owns liability for the payment and some may (but don't need to) provide technical acceptance solutions for merchants who accept Alipay, including mPOS.

User experience
===============

In the Barcode Payment solution, the customer opens the MPP app and presents the QR code/barcode to the merchant, who scans the QR Code/barcode to accept the payment, as illustrated.

> Note: In some cases, such as over-limit transactions or risk situations, the user may be required by the MPP to input the password to complete the payment.
