Terms and definitions
---------------------

The following table introduces commonly used terms in settlement and reconciliation.



| **Term** | **Definition** |
| --- | --- |
| Settlement | Refers to the process ofcalculating the net settlement amount for all transactions within a settlement batch and transferring the corresponding settlement funds on the predefined settlement date. |
| Settlement period | Refers to the time interval from the first transaction day to the day that Alipay should settle with you. The settlement period varies depending on the following dimensions:* For daily settlement, the settlement period is T+N, where N is a variable specified in your contract. Transactions that occur on the T date are all settled to you on the date of T+N. * For weekly settlement, the settlement period is W+N, where N is a variable specified in your contract. Transactions that occur during the week are all settled to you on the date of W+N. * For monthly settlement, the settlement period is M+N, where N is a variable specified in your contract. Transactions that occur during the month are all settled to you on the date of M+N. |
| Settlement batch | A settlement batch is formed when the unsettled funds in a settlement period meet the settlement prerequisites. |
| Currency conversion mode | Determines the exchange rate that is used for settlement and has two types: locked-in and non-locked-in. |
| Locked-in | When the transaction currency differs from the settlement currency, the settlement amount is determined by the exchange rate on the transaction date. |
| Non-locked-in | When the transaction currency differs from the settlement currency, the settlement amount is determined by the exchange rate on the next day of the transaction date. |

The settlement lifecycle from transaction occurrence to settlement completion varies based on different settlement period dimensions (daily, monthly, or weekly) and currency conversion modes.
