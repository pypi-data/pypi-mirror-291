Introduction
============

2023-09-13 03:30

The Alipay User-Presented Mode Payment product provides both customers and merchants a smooth payment experience.

To initiate a payment, the customer presents a payment code (generated from a payment app like an e-wallet) to the merchant for scanning. This payment flow can also work when the mobile phone for payment has a weak network connection.

As the merchant can get a clear payment result for each transaction, payment error rates can be reduced.

========

Product flow
============

The merchant scans the payment code for payment and initiates a payment request to Alipay. Alipay sends the payment request to Alipay+ MPP. Alipay+ MPP returns the payment result to Alipay after processing the payment and sends the payment result to the customer. After getting the payment result from Alipay+ MPP, Alipay sends the payment result to the merchant.
