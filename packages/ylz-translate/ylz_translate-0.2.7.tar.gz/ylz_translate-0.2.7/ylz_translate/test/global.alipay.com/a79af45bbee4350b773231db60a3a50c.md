Combined Payment allows buyers to complete purchases from various merchants with a single checkout process. After the payment is completed, Alipay settles the funds separately to the corresponding merchants. Combined Payment can be applied to various scenarios, including but not limited to:

*   E-commerce platforms, where buyers can make purchases from multiple merchants and make a combined payment.
*   Payment scenarios such as air travel, where buyers can make a single payment for both flight tickets and insurance, which are provided by different merchants.

Product highlight
-----------------

Combined Payment supports one-time checkout for products purchased from multiple merchants and in various currencies. Buyers can make payments without being aware of the differences between merchants, therefore enhancing the buyer's user experience. With Combined Payment, you can:

*   Increase average order value
*   Improve shopping cart conversion rate
*   Boost your Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV)
