Overview
--------

The Alipay fast food self-service payment solution can provide customers a smooth experience for restaurant self-ordering and self-purchasing. This solution allows customers to browse the menu, place an order, add options, and pay the bill freely without relying on service staff. With this digital payment transformation solution, labor cost is largely reduced and better customer experience is created with less waiting time, eliminated language barrier, and no cash involved.

Typical scenarios that will adapt well to self-service machines:

*   Take-away
*   Drive-thru (for Europe and America): A drive-through or drive-thru is a type of service provided by a business that allows customers to purchase products without leaving their cars.

Solution benefits
-----------------

Alipay fast food solution connects merchants and customers more closely by providing an efficient order and pay platform. With less labor cost, but better dining experience, customers and merchants can both benefit from this Alipay solution.

### Merchant benefits

**Less queuing time, better customer experience**

Popular fast food restaurants or any other popular service providers usually have too many customers queuing in line for getting a service, especially during the peak hours. Self-service machine can make the customers serve themselves by providing services on the machine in an easy way.

Besides, digitalized order and checkout process saves customers from preparing cash in the local currency and the language barrier with cashiers. Alipay provides very favorable exchange rate for the overseas payments.

**Easy to use**

Customers don't need to be trained before using the machine because the machine is designed in a quite easy and user-friendly way for customers to make an order and check out.

**Less labor cost, maximized profit**

Cashier\-staffed checkout and waiters-served ordering are quite costly for the merchant. Labor costs can be a significant expense for any business, and can be the single largest expense for a small business with a growing workforce.  By importing self-service machines, less employees needed in the business. You can cut your labor cost and maximize your profits.

**Accessible without internet**

Alipay users can complete the payment even when no internet connected.

### Service provider benefits

Service providers refer to those who provide services for integrating with Alipay solutions, such as ISVs. Relying on the openness of the Alipay platform, ISVs can quickly open the market and gain revenue.

Alipay can provide the following benefits for ISV/ISOs:

*   The most powerful technical support and the latest technology sharing in the electronic payment industry.
*   Successful digitalization experience from China market.
