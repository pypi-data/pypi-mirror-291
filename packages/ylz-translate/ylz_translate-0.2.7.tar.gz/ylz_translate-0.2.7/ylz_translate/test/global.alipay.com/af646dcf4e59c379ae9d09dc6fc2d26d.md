Settlement Summary
==================

2023-06-29 17:25

The Settlement Summary report is used to provide the merchant with a summary of the clearing data information. A Settlement Summary report is provided for each clearing cycle and contains the total number of transactions during the period, the amount of liquidation after rolling, and other related information. When no transaction occurs during a clearing cycle, the summary file is still provided, but the total amount is 0.

Report path and name
====================

The Settlement Summary report is a text file with UTF-8 encoding. The report storage path defaults to `/v1/settlements/<merchantIdByAcquirer>/<settlementDate>/` plus the file name. The file name differs for each settlement mode:

**Settlement by** **multiple payment methods:**

The report name is `settlementSummary_<settlementCurrency>_<settlementBatchId>_<seq>.csv`.

**Settlement by single payment method:**

The report name is different for Alipay+ MPPs and other payment methods.

*   For Alipay+ MPPs:

*   When Alipay+ MPPs are settled together: `settlementSummary_CONNECTWALLET_<settlementCurrency>_<settlementBatchId>_<seq>.csv`
*   When Alipay+ MPPs are settled individually: `settlementSummary_<pspName>_<settlementCurrency>_<settlementBatchId>_<seq>.csv`

*   For other payment methods: `settlementSummary_<paymentMethodType>_<settlementCurrency>_<settlementBatchId>_<seq>.csv`

Details about the variables in the report name:

*   **merchantIdByAcquirer**: the identity that Alipay assigns to the merchant.
*   **settlementDate**: the settlement date.
*   **pspName**: the name of the actual Alipay+ Mobile Payment Provider, such as GCash.
*   **settlementCurrency**: the agreed settlement currency, which is the same as the expense settlement currency in the file content.
*   **settlementBatchId**: the settlement batch code corresponds to the settlement batch number in the Summary reports.
*   **seq**: the document serial number.

Report fields
=============

The Settlement Summary document is divided into two parts: Settlement Summary and file end symbol. The file end symbol <END> appears in the last line of the file as the file end flag. The settlement summary details are illustrated by several fields and the corresponding values. The following table shows the details of the fields that appear in the report body:

### Sample 3

No transaction exists on December 25, 2018. On December 26, 2018, Alipay generates a CSV file with the file name `settlementSummary_KaKaoPay_USD_0000000000000000000_000.csv`.

    <END>

### Sample 4

When the acquirer is Hundsun, Alipay will calculate the settlement data of each transaction type for merchants, because Hundsun only provides the total settlement data. The total settlement data calculated by Alipay and Hundsun may be different, so Alipay provides the error correction information about the amount calculation differences. For example:

*   If the total _settlementAmountValue_ values calculated by Hundsun and Alipay are respectively `37164` and `37140`, the error correction information for _settlementAmountValue_ is `24`.
*   If the total _feeAmountValue_ values calculated by Hundsun and Alipay are respectively `760` and `760`, the error correction information for _feeAmountValue_ is `0`.
*   If the total _taxFeeAmountValue_ values calculated by Hundsun and Alipay are respectively `76` and `100`, the error correction information for _taxFeeAmountValue_ is `-24`.

> **Note**:
> 
> *   The merchant settles with the final settlement amount of Hundsun.
> *   The error correction information is on the second-to-last line of the settlement files.

On October 17, 2022, a merchant has three transactions, two for payments and one for a refund. The merchant's acquirer is Hundsun. On the settlement date of October 19, 2022, a CSV file with the file name `settlementItems_PAYPAY_JPY_2022101909031102123_000.csv` is generated by Alipay.

### Sample 5

Interchange++ is a pricing model that consists of the fees charged by the relevant issuing bank, card scheme, and acquirer for processing every transaction. This pricing model is transparent because it offers the most detailed breakdown of the true costs. The interchange++ pricing model includes the following three types of fees:

*   **Interchange fee**: The fee that is charged by the issuing bank.
*   **Scheme fee** (first+): The fee that is charged by the card scheme.
*   **Acquirer fee** (second+): The fee that is charged by the acquirer.

When the acquirer is 2C2P and the interchange++ pricing model is used, the settlement reports may have error correction information. The error correction information represents the discrepancy between the fee that should be charged and the fee that is actually charged, and is presented on the second-to-last line through the _feeAmountValue_ field of the settlement reports.

*   If the value of _feeAmountValue_ is positive, it means the fee that should be charged is less than the fee that is actually charged, and the acquirer needs to pay you the discrepancy fee.
*   If the value of _feeAmountValue_ is negative, it means the fee that should be charged is greater than the fee that is actually charged, and you need to pay the acquirer the discrepancy fee.

The acquirer sends the error correction information to Alipay irregularly. Alipay sends you the error correction information through the settlement reports.

For example, the following settlement summary report is returned with extra error correction information presented on the second-to-last line of the report.

copy

    settlementBatchId,customerId,acquirer,summaryType,settlementTime,count,settlementAmountValue,settlementCurrency,feeAmountValue,feeCurrency,taxFeeAmountValue,taxFeeCurrency,processingFeeAmountValue,processingFeeCurrency,nonGuaranteeCouponValue,nonGuaranteeCouponCurrency,disputeHandlingFee, disputeHandlingFeeCurrency, disputeReverseFee, disputeReverseFeeCurrency,interchangeFeeAmountValue,interchangeFeeCurrency, schemeFeeAmountValue,schemeFeeCurrency,acquirerMarkupAmountValue,acquirerMarkupCurrency,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
    2C2PXXXXXX0101,Oxxxx742,2C2P_SG,CAPTURE,2023-01-09T02:45:29+08:00,1,96,HKD,-4,HKD,0,HKD,,,,,,,,,-1,HKD,-2,HKD,-1,HKD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
    2C2PXXXXXX0101,Oxxxx742,2C2P_SG,TOTAL,2023-01-09T02:45:29+08:00,2,91,HKD,-9,HKD,0,HKD,,,,,,,,,-1,HKD,-2,HKD,-1,HKD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
    2C2PXXXXXX0101,Oxxxx742,2C2P_SG,default,2022-10-30T23:00:00+08:00,1,,,-5,SGD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
    <END>

Pay attention to the following information:

*   **settlementAmountValue** (_summaryType_ = `CAPTURE`): 96
*   **settlementCurrency** (_summaryType_ = `CAPTURE`): HKD
*   **feeAmountValue** (_summaryType_ = `TOTAL`): 91
*   **feeCurrency** (_summaryType_ = `TOTAL`): HKD
*   **feeAmountValue** (_summaryType_ = `default`): -5
*   **feeCurrency** (_summaryType_ = `default`): HKD

In the preceding report, when _summaryType_ is `TOTAL`, the value of _feeAmountValue_ is negative, and the fee currency is HKD. This means that you needs to pay the acquirer 5 HKD extra. There is only one transaction in this settlement batch, where _summaryType_ is `CAPTURE` and the settlement amount is 96 HKD. Therefore, the final settlement amount is the sum of `96` (_summaryType_ = `CAPTURE`) and `-5`(_summaryType_ = `default`), which is `91` (_summaryType_ = `TOTAL`).

> **Note**: In the same batch, the error correction information returned by the settlement detail report and the settlement summary report is the same.
