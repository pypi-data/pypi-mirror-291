You must edit **Notification URL** in the **Integration Settings** tab of Alipay Developer Center before you can receive the notification.

When a chargeback occurs or when the liability of the chargeback is judged, Alipay sends you the asynchronous notification through the **[notifyDispute](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/card/notify_dispute)** notification. When you receive the notification, you must return a response as instructed in [Requirements](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/cashierpay/notifications#JtjSl). Otherwise, Alipay resends the notification until a correct response is received.

The **[notifyDispute](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/card/notify_dispute)** notification provides the following functions:

*   When a chargeback occurs, you receive a notification of the chargeback information. The value of _disputeNotificationType_ in the notification is `DISPUTE_CREATED`.
*   When the liability of the chargeback is determined after you defend the chargeback, you receive a notification of the chargeback outcome. The value of _disputeNotificationType_ in the notification is `DISPUTE_JUDGED`. The outcome is indicated by the value of _disputeJudgedResult_:

*   `ACCEPT_BY_CUSTOMER`: The user assumes the liability. You can request to capture the payment.
*   `ACCEPT_BY_MERCHANT`: You assume the liability. You need to refund the user the payment amount.
