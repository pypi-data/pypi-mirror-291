The Merchant QR Code Payment solution is making use of a static QR code to represent the account of a merchant. In this payment solution, the customer needs to scan the QR code and then input the amount to complete the payment.

To provide such a payment service, one solution is that the merchant integrates with Alipay system through the interfaces that have been developed for this product.
