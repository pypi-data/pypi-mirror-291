The Dispute Guidance for Ant International Merchants provides direction on managing and resolving disputes, outlining the procedures and operational requirements for resolving disputes arising from various payment methods. This guidance is designed in line with the resolution principles of multiple disputes, following the Alipay+ Core rules, card scheme rules, and other applicable laws and regulations.

### Terms and definition

The following table shows the terms and corresponding definitions that appear in this guide.



| **Term** | **Definition** | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Alipay+ Core | Alipay+ Core (or "Alipay+") is a collaborative initiative with all Partners, that enables them to provide more open, digitalized, and inclusive payment services to worldwide consumers and merchants. | |
| Alipay+ Wallet | Alipay+ Wallet is an e-wallet entity that signs an agreement with the payer and processes transactions through Alipay+, including TrueMoney Wallet, GCash, BPI, CIMB, AlipayHK, KakaoPay, DANA, Akulaku, Rabbit LINE Pay, Touch'n Go eWallet, Boost, Doku, etc. | |
| Alternative Payment Method | Alternative Payment Method (APM) refers to a payment method other than credit/debit cards and Alipay+ Wallet, and is a general term for an interbank transfer payment method. | |
| Issuer | The Issuer is an entity that agrees with a payer to process a transaction for a payer via a payment network. In this Guidance, the Issuer is also the service provider of Alternative Payment Methods (APMs). | |
| Card scheme | International Card Organization, including Visa, Mastercard, American Express, UnionPay, JCB, Diners. | |
| Retrieval request | The Issuer initiates a request to the merchant for providing information or documents when the payer has concerns about the transaction within 360 natural days after the transaction. | |
| Refund escalation | The Issuer initiates a request to the merchant for a refund when the payer has concerns about the transaction within 360 natural days after the transaction. | |
| Chargeback | A chargeback occurs when a payer disputes a payment, typically due to fraud, non-receipt of items, receiving defective items, or duplicate deductions. The payer contacts the issuer to request funds back from a merchant. | |



Table 1:Â Definitions of terms

### Before you begin

When a chargeback occurs, you will receive a Notification of Change (NoC) from Antom with the chargeback information. To ensure you receive the notification, [Configure an address for receiving a NoC](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/dispute/noc) beforehand.

### Understand disputes

Before you handle disputes, familiarize yourself with the following topics:

*   [How the dispute works](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/dispute/process)
*   [Each party's responsibilities](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/dispute/pr)

### Handle chargebacks

When a dispute occurs, perform the following steps:

*   Check the [chargeback reason code](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/dispute/reason_code) to understand the chargeback type.
*   Handle the chargeback.

*   Follow the [time limits](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/dispute/timeframe) for each phase of the chargeback.
*   [Decide whether to accept or defend the chargeback](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/dispute/decision).
*   If you decide to defend the chargeback, submit [defense documents](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/dispute/defend_chargeback) as required.

### Prevent chargebacks

However, regardless of whether you win the chargeback defense, mounting chargebacks account for your chargeback ratio. A high chargeback ratio can lead to monthly fines or worse. Therefore, to prevent being labeled as a "high-risk merchant", you must learn the card scheme's [dispute monitoring program](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/dispute/monitor).  
Overall, preventing chargebacks is more important than defending against them. To this end, follow [best practices to minimize chargebacks](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/dispute/bp).

Apart from the above, Antom helps you to reduce fraudulent cases. For more information, see [Alipay's assistance in fraud control](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/dispute/fraud).
