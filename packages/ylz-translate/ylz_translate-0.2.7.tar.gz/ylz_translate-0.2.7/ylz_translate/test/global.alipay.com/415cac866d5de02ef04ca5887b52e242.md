Defend a chargeback
===================

2024-02-02 07:28

The requirements for defending against chargebacks vary depending on the reason for the chargeback. For all types of chargebacks, you must provide documents with details of transactions to help you build a strong case to challenge the chargeback.

### Compelling Evidence

Providing compelling evidence is key to defending chargeback, because it proves that users participated in the transaction, received the goods or services, or benefitted from the transaction. The most common situations and their respective compelling evidence are listed here.

Because some card schemes aggregate chargeback reason codes into a single reason code, it is impossible to get additional information about the underlying reason for the reason code.

Therefore, we recommend you try to identify which chargeback reason(s) might be applicable and provide as much proof as possible to ensure the defense is valid.
