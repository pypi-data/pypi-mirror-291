Settle and reconcile
====================

2023-05-25 06:43

Alipay provides financial reports to help you streamline your business workflows:

*   Use the settlement reports to check the total number of transactions in a period of time and the settlement amount.
*   Use the transaction report to check details of all successful transaction records, including records of payments and refunds.

With these reports, financial tasks such as validating funds received and reconciling balances can be completed more efficiently.

Settlement
==========

Alipay performs a merchant settlement at the end of each settlement period. This process occurs at the end of each settlement cycle or occurs when the settlement amount reaches a pre-defined level of imbalance (trigger-point).

Settlement cycle
----------------

The settlement cycle for AlipayCN and other Alipay+ Mobile Payment Provider (Alipay+ MPPs) are different. You can check the settlement cycle details for each wallet in the following section. If a shorter settlement cycle is desired, contact technical support for a customization assessment.

For each settlement cycle, the exchange rate used for settlement is different. The exchange rate used for settlement is the exchange rate between _order.orderAmount.currency_ and _settlementStrategy.settlementCurrency_.

### Settlement cycle details

The following table shows the settlement cycle details for each wallet:



| **Wallet** | **Settlement cycle** |
| --- | --- |
| **AlipayCN** | For AlipayCN, the settlement cycle is T+N (Transaction day + N days), where N is determined by the settlement scenario:* Single-currency settlement scenario: The value of *order.orderAmount.currency* and *settlementStrategy.settlementCurrency* in the **pay** API is the same, the settlement day is **T+N (N≥1)**. * Cross-currency settlement scenario: The value of *order.orderAmount.currency* and *settlementStrategy.settlementCurrency* in the **pay** API is not the same, the settlement day can be one of the following options: + **T+N (N≥1)** + **T+N (N≥2)** |
| **Other** Alipay+ MPP**s** | For other Alipay+ MPPs, the settlement cycle is **T+4** (Transaction day + 4 days). |



Table 1. Settlement cycle information for each wallet

### Exchange rate applied

If a currency conversion for your transaction needs to be performed and a refund is issued, the following exchange rates apply for each wallet with different settlement cycles:



| **Wallet** | **Settlement cycle** | **Exchange rate** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AlipayCN | T+N (N≥1) | The exchange rate on the date of the original payment will apply for payment and refund. |
| AlipayCN | T+N (N≥2) | The exchange rate on the next day of the original payment will apply for payment and the exchange rate on the next day of the refund will apply for refund. |
| Other Alipay+ MPPs | T+4 | The exchange rate on the next day of the original payment is used for payment and the exchange rate on the next day of the refund is used for refund. |



Table 2. Exchange rate for each wallet with different settlement cycles

> **Notes**:
> 
> *   Time zone: cross-border settlement GMT+8 local settlement time
> *   If remittance fails due to insufficient funds, there will be no settlement files.
> *   Currently, the settlement cut-off time is 23:59:59 UTC+8:00 on the settlement day. However, for transactions completed on Friday, weekends, and certain holidays, more time might be required for settlement. For the exact settlement period, contact Alipay Technical Support for details.

Settlement modes
----------------

If multiple payment methods are supported in your system for payment service, two settlement modes exist:

*   Settlement by single payment method: For Alipay+ MPPs, the settlement can be combined or conducted individually. For all the other payment methods, the settlement is conducted individually.
*   Settlement by multiple payment methods: Combined settlement of all the Alipay+ MPPs and other payment methods.

> **Notes**:
> 
> *   For Settlement by multiple payment methods mode, all payment methods must be settled together, without the option of choosing to just settle some of the payment methods together.
> *   The settlement that can be used is determined by your contract. Please check your contract before choosing the settlement mode.

The settlement mode specified in the contract influences the file name of these reports: Settlement Summary, Settlement Items, and Transaction Items. For example, if you specify the Settlement by multiple payment methods mode when signing the contract, the Settlement Summary and Settlement Items reports will be generated with the file naming rules of Settlement by multiple payment methods, even if only one payment method is involved for settlement. For more details about the report names, see [Obtain reports](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/cashierpay/reports).

Reconciliation
==============

For reconciliation, use the following three types of reports:

*   [Settlement Summary](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/cashierpay/settlementsummary): provides summary information, such as the total number of transactions in a period of time and the amount for settlement. For every clearing cycle, a settlement summary report is created, therefore, with the Settlement Summary report, you can check the summary of all clearing data in each clearing cycle.
*   [Settlement Items](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/cashierpay/settlementitems): provides transaction details within a settlement cycle. This file is provided in document form and is generated along with the summary file of the settlement cycle.
*   [Transaction Items](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/cashierpay/transactionitems): provides all successful transaction details on T day, including records of transactions and refunds. This file is generated on the T+1 day.

Reports generation and tasks
----------------------------

The above-mentioned three types of reports are provided on specific days:

*   The Settlement Summary and Settlement Items reports are generated one day after the settlement date.
*   The Transaction Items report is generated one day after the transaction date (**T+1**).
*   The settlement occurs at the end of each settlement period. If settlement fails due to insufficient funds, there will be no settlement files.

Each report is designed for specific tasks and you can download a report sample from the following table:



| **Report** | **Tasks** | **Report sample (SFTP)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Settlement Summary | Generated one day after the settlement date. You can use it to:* View the summary of all clearing data in each clearing cycle * Identify discrepancies between the summary report and detail report | [Download](https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_3pe5m7/afts/file/A*5LTZRZvpbgEAAAAAAAAAAAAADtl6AQ/settlementSummary_AlipayHK_HKD_202200000000000000_000.csv) |
