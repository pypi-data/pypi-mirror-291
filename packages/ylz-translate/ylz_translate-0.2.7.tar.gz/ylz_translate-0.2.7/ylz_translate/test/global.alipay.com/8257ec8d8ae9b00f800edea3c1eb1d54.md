POST /v1/authorizations/consult

Use this API to get the user authorization. After this API is called successfully, you can get the authorization URL and redirect users to the authorization URL to agree to authorize. After the user agrees to authorize, the wallet redirects the user back to a redirection URL that is reconstructed with values of _authRedirectUrl_, _authCode_, and _authState_. For example, the redirection URL might be https://www.merchant.com/authorizationResult?authCode=3AB2F588D14B43238637264FCA5AAF35&authState=663A8FA9-D836-48EE-8AA1-1FF682989DC7.

Result process logic
--------------------

For different request results, different actions are to be performed. See the following list for details:

*   If the value of _result.resultStatus_ is `S`, the authorization URL is successfully obtained by the _schemeUrl_, _applinkUrl,_ or _normalUrl_ field in the response. The merchant can redirect the user to this URL to agree to authorize for granting corresponding resource access permission.
*   If the value of _result.resultStatus_ is `U`, the API calling status is unknown. You can call this API again to retry the process.
*   If the value of _result.resultStatus_ is `F`, the authorization URL is failed to be obtained. Generally, this case is caused by system defects or system failure. Check the error codes and take the corresponding actions or contact Alipay technical support.

### Result/Error codes
