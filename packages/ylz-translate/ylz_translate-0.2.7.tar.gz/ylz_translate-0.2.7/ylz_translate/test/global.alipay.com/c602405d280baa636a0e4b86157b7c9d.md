Settlement summary report
=========================

2023-11-10 08:52

The settlement summary report includes information such as the total number of transactions and net settlement amount within a settlement period. The report is generated along with the settlement details report on the next day after receiving the bank receipt for the settlement. You can obtain this report through the [SFTP server](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/reconcile/perform#LYsyS) or [Alipay Global Merchant Portal](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/reconcile/perform#jfNCL).

Table 1. Parameters and descriptions in the settlement summary report

> **Note**: Use the header parameters to parse the transaction details report. The parameter order in the report downloaded from the SFTP server and Alipay Global Merchant Portal may not match the parameter order displayed in Table 1.

Error correction information
----------------------------

The settlement report you obtained may contain the error correction information in the following scenarios.

### Acquirer: Hundsun

The acquirer Hundsun only provides the final settlement total amount. Therefore, Alipay calculates the settlement details of each transaction for you. Due to the different calculation methods, the total settlement data calculated by Alipay and Hundsun may be different, so Alipay provides the error correction information about the amount calculation differences in the settlement report. The error correction information is displayed on the second-to-last line of the report and is represented by _settlementAmountValue_, _feeAmountValue_, and _taxFeeAmountValue_. For example:

*   If the total _settlementAmountValue_ values calculated by Hundsun and Alipay are respectively `37164` and `37140`, the error correction information for _settlementAmountValue_ is `24`.
*   If the total _feeAmountValue_ values calculated by Hundsun and Alipay are respectively `760` and `760`, the error correction information for _feeAmountValue_ is `0`.
*   If the total _taxFeeAmountValue_ values calculated by Hundsun and Alipay are respectively `76` and `100`, the error correction information for _taxFeeAmountValue_ is `-24`.

The final settlement amount to you is subject to the settlement amount provided by Hundsun. For information about the settlement report when the acquirer is Hundsun, see [Sample 2](#c6DD1).

### Interchange++ pricing model

Interchange++ is a pricing model that consists of the fees charged by the relevant issuing bank, card scheme, and acquirer for processing every transaction. This pricing model is transparent because it offers the most detailed breakdown of the true costs. The Interchange++ pricing model includes the following three types of fees:

*   **Interchange fee**: The fee that is charged by the issuing bank.
*   **Scheme fee** (first+): The fee that is charged by the card scheme.
*   **Acquirer fee** (second+): The fee that is charged by the acquirer.

When the acquirer is 2C2P and the Interchange++ pricing model is used, the settlement reports may have error correction information. The error correction information represents the discrepancy between the fee that should be charged and the fee that is actually charged, and is presented on the second-to-last line through the _feeAmountValue_ field of the settlement reports.

*   If the value of _feeAmountValue_ is positive, it means the fee that should be charged is less than the fee that is actually charged, and the acquirer needs to pay you the discrepancy fee.
*   If the value of _feeAmountValue_ is negative, it means the fee that should be charged is greater than the fee that is actually charged, and you need to pay the acquirer the discrepancy fee.

The acquirer sends the error correction information to Alipay irregularly. Alipay sends you the error correction information through the settlement reports.

In addition, under the Interchange++ pricing model, there may be a delay in the collection of Interchange++ fees. For example, for a transaction that happened on January 3, 2023, the interchange fee charged by the issuing bank was not settled in the same batch as other transactions, but the fee was charged in the next batch settlement. For more information about the settlement report that contains the error correction information under the Interchange++ pricing model, see [Sample 3](#TqQKv).

Report samples
==============

The following samples show settlement details reports in different scenarios.

Sample 1 (Standard report)
--------------------------

On the transaction day of December 25, 2018, the merchant with an ID of 102218800000000\*\*\*\* had two transactions, one for a payment and the other for a refund. After Alipay settled with you and you received the bank receipt, Alipay generated a settlement summary report in CSV. The details of the report are as follows:

In this example, the settlement currency (_settlementCurrency)_ is USD, and the values of the settlement amount (_settlementAmountValue_) under different settlement types (_summaryType_) are as follows:

*   `PAYMENT`: For the payment, the value of _settlementAmountValue_ is `1450`, indicating that Alipay needs to pay the merchant 1450 USD.
*   `REFUND`: For the refund, the value of _settlementAmountValue_ is `-725`, indicating that Alipay needs to refund the merchant 735 USD.
*   `TOTAL`: For the total settlement amount, the value of _settlementAmountValue_ is `725`, indicating that after calculating the settlement amounts of payment and refund, Alipay needs to settle a net settlement amount of 725 USD to the merchant.

Sample 2 (Acquirer Hundsun)
---------------------------

The following settlement summary report is an example of when the acquirer is Hundsun. The report includes ten payments and one refund, as well as the error correction information on the second-to-last line. The settlement date for the transactions under this batch was October 30th, 2022. After Alipay settled with you and you received the bank receipt, Alipay generated a settlement summary report in CSV. The details of the report are as follows:

[📎Settlement summary report-Sample 2.csv](https://idocs.yuque.com/attachments/yuque/0/2023/csv/12884741/1691562191704-442af88c-06cf-4c9d-a445-1409a9be1eb8.csv?x-yuque-pt-expires=4826775732411&x-yuque-pt-id=35944&x-yuque-pt-signature=J5XP4ISkR3U7x1bf0taNb6a18NI%3D)

In this sample, pay attention to the following information:

*   **_feeAmountValue_** (_transactionType_ = `default`): 0
*   **_feeCurrency_** (_transactionType_ = `default`): JPY
*   **_taxFeeAmountValue_** (_transactionType_ = `default`): -4
*   **_taxFeeCurrency_** (_transactionType_ = `default`): JPY
*   **_settlementAmountValue_** (_transactionType_ = `default`): \-4
*   **_settlementCurrency_** (_transactionType_ = `default`): JPY
*   **_settlementAmountValue_** (_transactionType_ = `PAYMENT`): 1056
*   **_settlementCurrency_** (_transactionType_ = `PAYMENT`): JPY
*   **_settlementAmountValue_** (_transactionType_ = `REFUND`): \-96
*   **_settlementCurrency_** (_transactionType_ = `REFUND`): JPY
*   **_settlementAmountValue_** (_transactionType_ = `TOTAL`): 956
*   **_settlementCurrency_** (_transactionType_ = `TOTAL`): JPY

where, in the error correction information line, that is, when the value of _transactionType_ is `default`, the values of _feeAmountValue_ and _taxFeeAmountValue_ are respectively `0` and `-4`, and the fee currencies are all `JPY`. The total settlement amount after the calculation is four yen. That is, the value of _settlementAmountValue_ is `-4` and the value of _settlementCurrency_ is `JPY`, which indicates that there is a difference of four yen in the settlement amount calculated by Hundsun and Alipay. In this report, the total settlement amount for payment is 1056 yen, and the total settlement amount for refund is -96 yen. After summarizing all the settlement amounts of payments, refunds, and error correction part, the final settlement amount is 956 yen, so when the _transactionType_ is `TOTAL`, the values of _settlementAmountValue_ and _settlementCurrency_ are `956` and `JPY` respectively.

Sample 3 (Interchange++ pricing model)
--------------------------------------

The following settlement summary report is an example of when the Interchange++ pricing model is used. The settlement report contains an authorization, two captures, a refund, and the error correction information of previous transactions returned by the acquirer. The error correction information is displayed on the second-to-last line of the report.

[📎Settlement summary report-Sample 3.csv](https://idocs.yuque.com/attachments/yuque/0/2023/csv/12884741/1691562199845-49406d2c-1363-4040-8634-157ce72b5c98.csv?x-yuque-pt-expires=4826775732411&x-yuque-pt-id=35944&x-yuque-pt-signature=1joNLYkdz4YycrrMB08oQC3iVR4%3D)

In this sample, pay attention to the following information:

*   **_feeAmountValue_** (_summaryType_ = `default`): -500
*   **_feeCurrency_** (_summaryType_ = `default`): HKD
*   **_settlementAmountValue_** (_summaryType_ = `default`): -500
*   **_settlementCurrency_** (_summaryType_ = `default`): HKD
*   **_settlementAmountValue_** (_summaryType_ = `AUTHORIZATION`): -3
*   **_settlementCurrency_** (_summaryType_ = `AUTHORIZATION`): HKD
*   **_settlementAmountValue_** (_summaryType_ = `CAPTURE`): 91
*   **_settlementCurrency_** (_summaryType_ = `CAPTURE`): HKD
*   **_settlementAmountValue_** (_summaryType_ = `REFUND`): -99
*   **_settlementCurrency_** (_summaryType_ = `REFUND`): HKD
*   **_settlementAmountValue_** (_summaryType_ = `TOTAL`): -511
*   **_settlementCurrency_** (_summaryType_ = `TOTAL`): HKD

where, when the _summaryType_ is `default`, the values of _feeAmountValue and feeCurrency_ are `-500` and `HKD` respectively. That is, you need to pay an additional fee of 500 HKD to the acquirer, and the error correction value of _settlementAmountValue_ is `-500`. In this batch, there is one authorization with a settlement amount of -3 HKD, two captures with a settlement amount of 96 HKD, and one refund with a settlement amount of -99 HKD. Therefore, the final settlement amount is the sum of the settlement amounts of different transaction types, which is -511 HKD. That is, when the _summaryType_ is `TOTAL`, the value of _settlementAmountValue_ is `-511`, and the value of _settlementCurrency_ is `HKD`.

> **Note**: In the same settlement batch, the error correction amounts in the settlement details report and the settlement summary report are the same.
