2023-07-04 12:17

You can fetch reconciliation reports to view details of transactions in two ways:

*   Download from SFTP server
*   Download from Alipay Global Merchant Portal

Download from SFTP server
=========================

You can fetch reconciliation reports to view details of transactions. Alipay uploads reports to a specific directory in the SFTP to be downloaded, and all reports are UTF-8 encoded. To obtain your reports through SFTP, complete the following steps:

1.  Contact Alipay Technical support ([overseas\_support@service.alibaba.com](mailto:overseas_support@service.alibaba.com)) to obtain the SFTP login credentials and submit your public IP address through which you visit the SFTP server.
2.  Log in to the SFTP server to download reports. Use the following settings to log in and obtain reports:

*   Port: 22
*   Host name: isftp.alipay.com
*   Username and password

> **Notesï¼š**
> 
> *   SFTP accounts that are not used for 90 days will be disabled.
> *   Reports older than seven days on the SFTP server might be removed. It is suggested to download the reports within three days. If the report you need is deleted, contact Alipay Technical Support for help.
> *   Use the standard host name "isftp.alipay.com" of Alipay SFTP server rather than a fixed IP address to log in your Alipay SFTP account. Alipay disables IP address 198.11.150.\*\* on February, 18 2022. You will not be able to log in and download Alipay reconciliation reports if you use this fixed IP address. If you have more questions or requirements, please contact Alipay Technical support (overseas\_support@service.alibaba.com).

The report name is `settlementSummary_<settlementCurrency>_<settlementBatchId>_<seq>.csv`.

**Settlement by single payment method:**
