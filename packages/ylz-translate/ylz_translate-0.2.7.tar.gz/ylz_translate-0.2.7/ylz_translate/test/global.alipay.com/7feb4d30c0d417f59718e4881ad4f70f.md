Reports and reconciliation
==========================

2022-03-09 05:52

Alipay provides financial reports to help you streamline your business workflows. You can download and use reports to perform financial tasks, such as validating funds received and reconciling balances.

Settlement modes
================

If multiple wallets are supported in your system for payment service, two settlement modes exist:

*   Settlement for single wallet: settlement for each Alipay+ Mobile Payment Partner (Alipay+ MPP) wallet is conducted individually
*   Settlement for multiple wallets: combined settlement of all Alipay+ MPP wallets

Note: For the multiple wallets settlement mode, all wallets must be settled together, without the option of choosing certain wallets to settle together.

For reconciliation, three types of reports are provided to the merchant: [Settlement Summary](https://global.alipay.com/doc/ams/settlementsummary_online), [Settlement Items](https://global.alipay.com/doc/ams/settlementitems_online), and [Transaction Items](https://global.alipay.com/doc/ams/transactionitems_online). The file name for a specific type of report differs for each settlement mode. If you select the multiple wallets settlement mode when signing the contract, the Settlement Summary and Settlement Items files will be created based on the settlement mode of multiple wallets settlement, even if only one Alipay+ MPP wallet is involved for the settlement.

More details about the reports are illustrated in the [Reports](#qBpeO) section.

Settlement schedule
===================

Alipay performs a merchant settlement at the end of each settlement period, which brings merchants into balance. This process occurs at the end of each settlement cycle, or occurs when the settlement amount reaches some pre-defined level of imbalance (trigger-point).

Reports

This section provides information about how to get reports and details about each type of report.

Obtaining reports  

--------------------

You can fetch reconciliation reports to view details of transactions. Alipay uploads reports to a specific directory in the SFTP for being downloaded, and all reports are UTF-8 encoded. To obtain your reports through SFTP, complete the following steps.

1.  Contact Alipay Technical support ([overseas\_support@service.alibaba.com](mailto:overseas_support@service.alibaba.com)) to obtain the SFTP login credentials and submit your public IP address through which you visit the SFTP server.
2.  Log in to SFTP server to download reports. Use the following settings to log in and obtain files:

*   Port: 22
*   Host name: isftp.alipay.com
*   Username and password
