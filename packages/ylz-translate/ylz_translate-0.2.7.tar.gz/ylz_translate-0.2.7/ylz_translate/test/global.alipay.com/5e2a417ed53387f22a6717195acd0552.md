The settlement detail report contains transaction settlement details for all transactions within a settlement period. The report is generated along with the settlement summary report on the next day after receiving the bank receipt for the settlement. You can obtain this report through the [SFTP server](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/reconcile/perform#LYsyS) or [Alipay Global Merchant Portal](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/reconcile/perform#jfNCL).

Table 1. Parameters and descriptions in the settlement details report

> **Note**: Use the header parameters to parse the transaction details report. The parameter order in the report downloaded from the SFTP server and Alipay Global Merchant Portal may not match the parameter order displayed in Table 1.

Error correction information
----------------------------

The settlement report you obtained may contain the error correction information in the following scenarios.

### Acquirer: Hundsun

The acquirer Hundsun only provides the final settlement total amount. Therefore, Alipay calculates the settlement details of each transaction for you. Due to the different calculation methods, the total settlement data calculated by Alipay and Hundsun may be different, so Alipay provides the error correction information about the amount calculation differences in the settlement report. The error correction information is displayed on the second-to-last line of the report and is represented by _settlementAmountValue_, _feeAmountValue_, and _taxFeeAmountValue_. For example:

*   If the total _settlementAmountValue_ values calculated by Hundsun and Alipay are respectively `37164` and `37140`, the error correction information for _settlementAmountValue_ is `24`.
*   If the total _feeAmountValue_ values calculated by Hundsun and Alipay are respectively `760` and `760`, the error correction information for _feeAmountValue_ is `0`.
*   If the total _taxFeeAmountValue_ values calculated by Hundsun and Alipay are respectively `76` and `100`, the error correction information for _taxFeeAmountValue_ is `-24`.

The final settlement amount to you is subject to the settlement amount provided by Hundsun. For information about the settlement report when the acquirer is Hundsun, see [Sample 2](#c6DD1).

### Interchange++ pricing model

Interchange++ is a pricing model that consists of the fees charged by the relevant issuing bank, card scheme, and acquirer for processing every transaction. This pricing model is transparent because it offers the most detailed breakdown of the true costs. The Interchange++ pricing model includes the following three types of fees:

*   **Interchange fee**: The fee that is charged by the issuing bank.
*   **Scheme fee** (first+): The fee that is charged by the card scheme.
*   **Acquirer fee** (second+): The fee that is charged by the acquirer.

When the acquirer is 2C2P and the Interchange++ pricing model is used, the settlement reports may have error correction information. The error correction information represents the discrepancy between the fee that should be charged and the fee that is actually charged, and is presented on the second-to-last line through the _feeAmountValue_ field of the settlement reports.

*   If the value of _feeAmountValue_ is positive, it means the fee that should be charged is less than the fee that is actually charged, and the acquirer needs to pay you the discrepancy fee.
*   If the value of _feeAmountValue_ is negative, it means the fee that should be charged is greater than the fee that is actually charged, and you need to pay the acquirer the discrepancy fee.

The acquirer sends the error correction information to Alipay irregularly. Alipay sends you the error correction information through the settlement reports.

In addition, under the Interchange++ pricing model, there may be a delay in the collection of Interchange++ fees. For example, for a transaction that happened on January 3, 2023, the interchange fee charged by the issuing bank was not settled in the same batch as other transactions, but the fee was charged in the next batch settlement. For more information about the settlement report that contains the error correction information under the Interchange++ pricing model, see [Sample 3](#TqQKv).

Report samples
==============

The following samples show settlement details reports in different scenarios.

Sample 1 (Standard report)
--------------------------

On the transaction day of December 25, 2018, the merchant with an ID of 102218800000000\*\*\*\* had two transactions, one for a payment and the other for a refund. After Alipay settled with you and you received the bank receipt, Alipay generated a settlement details report in CSV. The details of the report are as follows:

[📎Settlement details report-Sample 1.csv](https://idocs.yuque.com/attachments/yuque/0/2024/csv/12884741/1716261447135-e0076b1b-360a-4043-866a-91e7884f4d56.csv?x-yuque-pt-expires=4826765468981&x-yuque-pt-id=35944&x-yuque-pt-signature=exfHeVpCoWgaCRy5hIEDTguiMR8%3D)

In this example, transactions made in KRW need to be settled in USD, so the value of _quoteCurrencyPair_ is `USD/KRW`. The exchange rate was 1 USD = 1200.0000 KRW, so the value of _quotePrice_ value is `1200.0000`.

*   **Information about the payment:**

*   _transactionId_: The transaction ID is 201812251907410100000000011\*\*\*\*, which is the same as the value of _paymentId_ in the original payment.
*   _transactionAmountValue_: The transaction amount is 18000 (KRW), which corresponds to 15.00 (USD).  
*   _feeAmountValue_: The processing fee charged by the acquirer is 0.50 (USD).
*   _settlementAmountValue_: The net settlement amount, which is the transaction amount minus fees. In this example, the value of this parameter is the value of _transactionAmountValue_ minus the value of _feeAmountValue_, which is 14.50 (USD).

*   **Information about the refund:**

*   _transactionId_: The transaction ID is 201812251907410200000000004\*\*\*\*, which is the same as the value of _refundId_ in the original refund.
*   _transactionAmountValue_: The transaction amount is -9000 KRW, which corresponds to -7.50 (USD). That is, the refund amount is 7.5 USD.
*   _settlementAmountValue_: The net settlement amount, which is the transaction amount minus fees. In this example, the handling fee charged for the original payment is not returned in the refund, so the net settlement amount is -7.50 (USD).

[📎Settlement details report-Sample 2.csv](https://idocs.yuque.com/attachments/yuque/0/2024/csv/12884741/1716261484829-2c851836-57b6-4386-b08b-88126bd5c7aa.csv?x-yuque-pt-expires=4826765468981&x-yuque-pt-id=35944&x-yuque-pt-signature=FQpD903I7EOF3yMjiuwBzdo5Xso%3D)

In this sample, the main information of the error correction information is as follows:

*   **_feeAmountValue_** (_transactionType_ = `default`): 0
*   **_feeCurrency_** (_transactionType_ = `default`): JPY
*   **_taxFeeAmountValue_** (_transactionType_ = `default`): 3
*   **_taxFeeCurrency_** (_transactionType_ = `default`): JPY
*   **_settlementAmountValue_** (_transactionType_ = `default`): 3
*   **_settlementCurrency_** (_transactionType_ = `default`): JPY

where, the values of _feeAmountValue_ and _taxFeeAmountValue_ are respectively `0` and `3`. The total settlement amount after the calculation is three yen, with _settlementAmountValue_ of `3` and _settlementCurrency_ of `JPY`. This indicates that there is a difference of three yen in the settlement amount calculated by Hundsun and Alipay.

[📎Settlement details report-sample 3.csv](https://idocs.yuque.com/attachments/yuque/0/2024/csv/12884741/1716261510535-2eb9db5f-9e0a-40ec-b846-858d0890ab74.csv?x-yuque-pt-expires=4826765468981&x-yuque-pt-id=35944&x-yuque-pt-signature=njqZOsj%2Bpg2Bt5Wogx2lPJI%2FwsI%3D)

In this example, for the capture that occurred on January 3, 2023, there is a supplementary charge of the fee that was charged by the issuing bank in this settlement batch. The value of _interchangeFeeAmountValue_ is `4` and the value of _interchangeFeeCurrency_ is `HKD`, which means that you need to pay an additional fee of 4 HKD to the issuing bank. It is noteworthy that the value of _transactionAmountValue_ of this capture in this report is `0` because the transaction amount had already been settled in a previous batch. This batch settlement only involves the supplementary charge for the interchange fee of this capture.

The processing fee and currency in the error correction line are as follows:

*   **_feeAmountValue_** (_summaryType_ = `default`): -500
*   **_feeCurrency_** (_summaryType_ = `default`): SGD

where, the values of _feeAmountValue_ and _feeCurrency_ are `-500` and `SGD` respectively, which indicates that you need to pay the acquirer an additional fee of 500 SGD.

> **Note**: In the same settlement batch, the error correction amounts in the settlement details report and the settlement summary report are the same.
