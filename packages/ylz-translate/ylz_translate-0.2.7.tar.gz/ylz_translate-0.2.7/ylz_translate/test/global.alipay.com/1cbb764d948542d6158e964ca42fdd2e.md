User experience
===============

2023-08-01 07:39

This topic provides complete information on the user experience of initiating the authorization, completing the authorization, and receiving the authorization result. Experiences for each possible redirection process between the merchant and payment method are also provided.

Users can initiate the authorization on three merchant terminal types: WEB, WAP, or APP. After the user initiates the authorization, the user will be redirected to the payment method client to complete the authorization. As the payment method supports the WEB, WAP, or APP client type, multiple redirection experiences (from the merchant to payment method) exist. In addition, for each merchant terminal type, the subsequent redirection mode and the supported redirection page type are different depending on each payment method's capability.

The user experiences from different types of merchant and payment method clients are presented in these sections:

*   [Merchant terminal type: WEB](#b4FbL)
*   [Merchant terminal type: WAP](#uAvcl)
*   [Merchant terminal type: APP](#gL4Zp)

The authorization results for different cases are presented in these sections:

*   [Authorization success](#Fq3ar)
*   [Authorization failed](#GUdqV)

User experience
===============

This section provides a complete user experience of initiating the authorization, completing the authorization, and receiving the authorization result.

Merchant terminal type: WEB
---------------------------

If the user initiates the authorization on a WEB merchant terminal, the user will be redirected to a WEB payment method client. The payment method's website page provides one of the following possible methods for users to complete the authorization:

Scan to authorize

Log in to authorize

In this case, the user will be redirected to a payment method's website page where a QR code is presented for the user to scan and authorize. For example:

![Image 3: 1-1.jpg](https://idocs-assets.marmot-cloud.com/storage/idocs87c36dc8dac653c1/1646189912617-133d95b3-be48-42f2-9e79-52c02a3c8c0e.jpeg)

Figure 1. Website page of the scan-to-authorize type

In this case, the user will be redirected to a payment method's website page where an account and password are required to complete the authorization. For example:

![Image 4: 1-2.jpg](https://idocs-assets.marmot-cloud.com/storage/idocs87c36dc8dac653c1/1646190318324-c2b6af55-e342-45f2-b508-acc0797c823c.jpeg)

Figure 2. Website page with login prompt

The following table shows which kind of experiences are provided by each payment method when the merchant terminal type is WEB:

Table 1. Supported website page types for each payment method when the payment method client type is WEB

Merchant terminal type: WAP
---------------------------

If the user initiates the authorization on a WAP merchant client, the user will be redirected to a WAP payment method client: a log-in-to-authorize WAP page.

#### Login-to-authorize WAP page

The user is redirected from a WAP merchant page to a WAP payment method page where an account and password are required to complete the authorization.

![Image 5: 1-3.jpg](https://idocs-assets.marmot-cloud.com/storage/idocs87c36dc8dac653c1/1646190351541-59d5a02c-5ab8-454e-9ec5-64a6f424a65b.jpeg)

Figure 3. Redirection from a merchant WAP page to a login-to-authorize WAP page

> **Notes:**
> 
> *   After completing the authorization on the payment method part, the user is redirected back to the merchant page with a value of _authCode_ by the default browser.
> *   The payment method authorization page must be a WAP page. If the payment method does not provide a WAP authorization page, redirection from the WAP merchant client to the payment method is not supported.

The following table shows the experience provided by each payment method when the merchant terminal type is WAP:



| **Payment method** | **Login-to-authorize WAP page** | **Note** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GCash | ✅ |  |
| DANA | ✅ |  |
| AlipayHK | ✅ |  |
| KakaoPay |  | The user needs to have the payment method app installed to authorize. |
| Touch 'n Go | ✅ |  |
| TrueMoney | ✅ |  |
| AlipayCN |  | The payment method app needs to be downloaded to authorize. |
| Naver Pay | ✅ |  |



Table 2. Supported redirection experience for each payment method when the merchant terminal type is WAP

Merchant terminal type: APP
---------------------------

If the user initiates the authorization on a terminal page with an APP terminal type, the user will be redirected to one of the following possible terminals:

Log-in-to-authorize WAP page

Payment method app

The user is redirected from a merchant app to a WAP payment method page where an account and password are required to complete the authorization.

![Image 6: 1-4.jpg](https://idocs-assets.marmot-cloud.com/storage/idocs87c36dc8dac653c1/1646190371092-0a88bbc6-1be1-41f5-9749-ac3b83c674d2.jpeg)

Figure 4. Redirection from a merchant app to a WAP payment method page

The user is redirected from a merchant app to the payment method app to complete the payment:

*   If the user has the payment method app installed, the payment method app is opened.
*   If the user does not have the payment method app installed, the user will be redirected to one of the following WAP pages:

*   A WAP page to log in to authorize
*   A WAP page to download the payment method app

**Payment method** **installed**

If the user has the payment method app installed, the user is redirected from a merchant app to the payment method's app to complete the authorization via one of the three possible ways:

*   Via a universal link or app link: The user is redirected to open the payment method app to complete the authorization.

![Image 7: 1-5.jpg](https://idocs-assets.marmot-cloud.com/storage/idocs87c36dc8dac653c1/1646190389954-e9ee70b1-f566-4586-8feb-2ac8a73fe55c.jpeg)

Figure 5. Redirection from a merchant app to a payment method app via a universal link or app link

*   Via an intermediate page: The user is first redirected to open an intermediate page, and then to open the payment method app to complete the authorization.

Figure 9. A log-in-to-authorize WAP page

> **Notes**:
> 
> *   If the user has the payment method app installed, the payment method app is opened in one of the following ways：
> 
> *   Via a universal link or an app link
> 
> *   Universal Link: Allow users to intelligently follow links to content in your app or to your website in the iOS system. For more information, see [iOS Universal Links](https://developer.apple.com/ios/universal-links/).
> *   App Link: A deep link that when tapped, takes the user directly to a page within a specific app. For more information, see [Android App Links](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links).
> 
> *   Via an intermediate page
> *   Via a dynamic link (Only for GCash)
> 
> *   Which type of payment method client the user is redirected to is determined by the target payment method's capability and the merchant's [integration method](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/autodebitpay/redirect_merchant-wallet#UWtzO). There are three types of URLs returned by the value of _authUrl_ in the [**consult**](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/authconsult) response. Each type of URL leads to a different payment method redirection experience:
> 
> *   If the _authUrl_ value is an ordinary WAP address, the user is redirected to a log-in-to-authorize WAP page.
> *   If the _authUrl_ value is a URL scheme (WAP-scheme), the user is redirected to open the browser first and then open the payment method app.
> *   If the _authUrl_ value is a universal link or app link, the user is redirected to open the payment method app directly.

The following table shows which kind of experiences are provided by each payment method when the merchant terminal type is APP:



| **Payment method** | **Log-in-to-authorize WAP page** | **Payment method****a****pp** | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Installed** | | **Not installed** |
