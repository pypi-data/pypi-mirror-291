The test wallet app can simulate Alipay+ payment methods to complete payment or vaulting process on both desktop and mobile devices. Follow the steps below to ensure a successful payment or vaulting process.

Call the [**pay**](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/ams/payment_cashier) API in sandbox to obtain the payment or vaulting continuation URL.

For desktop devices
-------------------

On desktop devices, you can simulate the payment or vaulting process using the  following two methods:

### Scan the code

If the URL shows a QR code, select the corresponding payment method you want to test in the test wallet app, and scan the code to complete the payment or vaulting process.

#### For Checkout Payment

See the flowchart below for the Checkout Payment process.
