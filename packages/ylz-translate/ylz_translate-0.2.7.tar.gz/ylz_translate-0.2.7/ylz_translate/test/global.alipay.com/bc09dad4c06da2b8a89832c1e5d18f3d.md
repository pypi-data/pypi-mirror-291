Pay Evaluation
==============

Pay Evaluation ensures sufficient funds for automatic deductions by checking the balance of the selected payment method. If the balance is insufficient, a prompt appears to guide the buyer to top up, preventing payment failures and increasing overall success rates.

See the following buyer experience for details:

1.  On your checkout page, after a buyer selects a payment method for a payment, a prompt indicating insufficient balance appears to guide them to top up.
2.  The buyer taps **Continue to top up** to be redirected to the payment method app for topping up.
3.  After the buyer completes the top-up, they are redirected back to your page to proceed with the payment.

Auto Retry
==========

Auto Retry recovers lost payments by automatically retrying deductions at the optimal timing. Leveraging user behavior, activeness, and common payday patterns, Alipay+ ensures a high success rate for retries.
