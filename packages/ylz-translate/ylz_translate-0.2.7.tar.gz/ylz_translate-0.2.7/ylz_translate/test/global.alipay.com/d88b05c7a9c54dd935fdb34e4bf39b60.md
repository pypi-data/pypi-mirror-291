Solution benefits
-----------------

Alipay ticket solution can provide customers a convenient and relaxed ticket purchase experience. Both the customers and merchants can benefit from the Alipay ticket solution.

### Merchant benefits

*   **Better purchasing and reservation experience**  
    Popular attractions usually have many customers queuing in line for getting the attraction ticket, especially during the peak hours. Alipay ticket solution can speed up the ticket purchasing process by providing a cashless and efficient payment method with minimum actions to take by both customers and cashier staff.  
      
    Even if customers are at home, they can make ticket purchases and restaurant reservations through a mobile device. Besides, Alipay provides a pretty good exchange rate when settling the payment.  
      
    
*   **Easier financial management, higher operation efficiency  
    **With a unified entry provided by Alipay for digital bill traffics, you can get the data for purchase easily from the Alipay system. Besides, less cash income means less cash management risk and cost. Your financial management is greatly simplified.  
      
    Previously, daily accounting is not an easy work. Financial management takes time and labor resources. Besides, it is not easy to make a statistical study of the orders made during a day if you already have limited labor resources. With Alipay service, you can easily access to the data of all bills, and make good use of your daily business data to analyze the customer flow pattern, optimize the attraction management, and keep your financial status healthy and in order.  
      
    
*   **More accessible marketing promotion and coupon issuance**  
    Alipay provides a discovery platform with marketing campaign or coupon issuance for its users, which is the best advertising position for attractions to expose their services, activities, or any other useful information for in-destination tourists after they complete the ticket purchase on Alipay.  
      
    Therefore, Alipay can not only change the payment way, but also provide a new and more efficient way to  display information about promotion and coupons.

### Service provider benefits

Service providers refer to those who provide services for integrating with Alipay solutions, such as ISVs. Relying on the openness of the Alipay platform, ISVs can quickly open the market and gain revenue.

*   The most powerful technical support and the latest technology sharing in the electronic payment industry.
*   Successful digitalization experience from China market.
