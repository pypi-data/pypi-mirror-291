Chargeback response procedure
=============================

2023-05-17 02:08

When you receive a chargeback notification, follow these steps before you respond.

1.  Check the reason code for the chargeback. This will tell you why the chargeback has been raised, what to ask the user, and how to respond to it.
2.  (If applicable) Contact the user to discuss the chargeback before you accept or challenge it. Contacting the user will help you decide how to respond to the case and what sort of evidence you might need to defend it.
3.  Consider accepting liability. Defending a chargeback can be a lengthy and costly process, so you might not want to defend against every chargeback. Weight the pros and cons before you proceed.
4.  Make a decision. After considering the above steps, you have two choices regarding a chargeback:

*   Accept. If the you agree with the chargeback and the specific reason given, you can accept the chargeback. If you fail to respond within the required time frame, the chargeback result is the same as that of accepting it.
*   Challenge. If you want to defend against the chargeback, you need to submit all assembled evidence within the required time frame.
