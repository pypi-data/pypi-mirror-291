Hermite Series, "Physicists" (:mod:`numpy.polynomial.hermite`)
==============================================================

This module provides a number of objects (mostly functions) useful for
dealing with Hermite series, including a `Hermite` class that
encapsulates the usual arithmetic operations.  (General information
on how this module represents and works with such polynomials is in the
docstring for its "parent" sub-package, `numpy.polynomial`).

def hermadd(c1, c2):
    """
    Add one Hermite series to another.
    Returns the sum of two Hermite series `c1` + `c2`.  The arguments
    are sequences of coefficients ordered from lowest order term to
    highest, i.e., [1,2,3] represents the series ``P_0 + 2*P_1 + 3*P_2``.
    Parameters
    ----------
    c1, c2 : array_like
        1-D arrays of Hermite series coefficients ordered from low to
        high.
    Returns

    -----
    Unlike multiplication, division, etc., the sum of two Hermite series
    is a Hermite series (without having to "reproject" the result onto
    the basis set) so addition, just like that of "standard" polynomials,
    is simply "component-wise."

    sequences of coefficients are from lowest order term to highest, i.e.,
    [1,2,3] represents the series ``P_0 + 2*P_1 + 3*P_2``.

def hermval(x, c, tensor=True):

    Evaluate an Hermite series at points x.
    If `c` is of length `n + 1`, this function returns the value:
    .. math:: p(x) = c_0 * H_0(x) + c_1 * H_1(x) + ... + c_n * H_n(x)
    The parameter `x` is converted to an array only if it is a tuple or a
    list, otherwise it is treated as a scalar. In either case, either `x`
    or its elements must support multiplication and addition both with
    themselves and with the elements of `c`.
    If `c` is a 1-D array, then `p(x)` will have the same shape as `x`.  If
    `c` is multidimensional, then the shape of the result depends on the
    value of `tensor`. If `tensor` is true the shape will be c.shape[1:] +
    x.shape. If `tensor` is false the shape will be c.shape[1:]. Note that
    scalars have shape (,).
    Trailing zeros in the coefficients will be used in the evaluation, so
    they should be avoided if efficiency is a concern.
    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, compatible object
        If `x` is a list or tuple, it is converted to an ndarray, otherwise
        it is left unchanged and treated as a scalar. In either case, `x`
        or its elements must support addition and multiplication with
        themselves and with the elements of `c`.
    c : array_like
        Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficients for terms of
        degree n are contained in c[n]. If `c` is multidimensional the
        remaining indices enumerate multiple polynomials. In the two
        dimensional case the coefficients may be thought of as stored in
        the columns of `c`.
    tensor : boolean, optional
        If True, the shape of the coefficient array is extended with ones
        on the right, one for each dimension of `x`. Scalars have dimension 0
        for this action. The result is that every column of coefficients in
        `c` is evaluated for every element of `x`. If False, `x` is broadcast
        over the columns of `c` for the evaluation.  This keyword is useful
        when `c` is multidimensional. The default value is True.

    where the points `(a, b, c)` consist of all triples formed by taking
    `a` from `x`, `b` from `y`, and `c` from `z`. The resulting points form
    a grid with `x` in the first dimension, `y` in the second, and `z` in
    the third.
    The parameters `x`, `y`, and `z` are converted to arrays only if they
    are tuples or a lists, otherwise they are treated as a scalars. In
    either case, either `x`, `y`, and `z` or their elements must support
    multiplication and addition both with themselves and with the elements
    of `c`.
    If `c` has fewer than three dimensions, ones are implicitly appended to
    its shape to make it 3-D. The shape of the result will be c.shape[3:] +
    x.shape + y.shape + z.shape.
    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y, z : array_like, compatible objects
        The three dimensional series is evaluated at the points in the
        Cartesian product of `x`, `y`, and `z`.  If `x`,`y`, or `z` is a
        list or tuple, it is first converted to an ndarray, otherwise it is
        left unchanged and, if it isn't an ndarray, it is treated as a
        scalar.
    c : array_like
        Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficients for terms of
        degree i,j are contained in ``c[i,j]``. If `c` has dimension
        greater than two the remaining indices enumerate multiple sets of
        coefficients.
    Returns
    -------
    values : ndarray, compatible object
        The values of the two dimensional polynomial at points in the Cartesian
        product of `x` and `y`.
