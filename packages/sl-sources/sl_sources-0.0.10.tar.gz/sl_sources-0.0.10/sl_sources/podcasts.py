You are a professional researcher who has been given the following instructions:
```
{prompt_asking_for_type_of_episode}
```

You are being paid by the hour, but will be given a $200 tip if you can find some really good informational gems.

You have been asked to find podcast episodes that match the instructions given to you.
Your first goal is to run a search on ListenNotes, a podcast database.
ListenNotes does not use semantic search, and so you have to choose keywords and choose them carefully.
You must find a balance between being too specific and too general.
Being too specific may result in no results, while being too general may result in irrelevant results.
ListenNotes searches for keywords in episode title, podcast name, episode description, author, and transcript

Lets take this step by step:
1) Consider what you know about the topic, and specific orgs, events, entities, people, etc. that are relevant.
2) Based on what you know decide on 3 keywords or phrases that you think will help you find the right podcast episodes.
3) Give your answer as a list of strings, each string being a keyword or phrase. Do not include any other words other than the list of strings

For example if you were asked to find podcasts about "Economic perils in the The history of the United States" you would answer:
json```
[
    "Economic problems history United States",
    "Great depression, 2008 recession, stock market crash",
    "Economic history of America"
]
```

Respond with a JSON block containing an array of strings.

You are a professional researcher who has been given the following instructions:
```
{prompt}
```

In your research you have found a number of different podcasts. One of the podcast Episodes you found was:
```
**Podcast Title**: {episode.podcast_title}
**Episode Title**: {episode.episode_title}
**Description**:
{episode.description}
```

Your job is determine if the podcast is worth listening to.
You can only tell so much from just the title and description, but we dont have time to listen to every podcast we found.
Please give a prediction of how likely it is that you would pick this podcast to share with your boss after listening to it (i.e. it fulfills the instructions)

Your prediction should be a number between 0 and 1, where 0 is not at all likely, and 1 is very likely.
0 would mean you are certain right now that you would not share it.
0.1 would mean you are very unlikely to share it.
0.3 would mean that you are unlikely to share it.
0.5 would mean that it really depends on the content.
0.7 would mean that you are likely to share it.
0.9 would mean that you are very likely to share it.
1.0 would means that you can tell right now from the title and description that you would share it.

Your boss will take a random sample of your predictions and you will be paid a $200 tip if your prediction is accurate overall.

Take this step by step:
1) Consider the requirements inferred by the instructions you were given.
2) Consider the title and description of the podcast episode and how well it meets the requirements.
3) Consider how likely you would be to share this podcast with your boss after listening to it.
4) Give your answer as a json. Don't give any other information other than the json.

For example, if you found an episode you were likely to share you would answer:
{{
    "reasoning": "...add your reasoning here..."
    "prediction": 0.7
}}
Remember only give the json and no other words around it. Do all your steps in the reasoning section.
