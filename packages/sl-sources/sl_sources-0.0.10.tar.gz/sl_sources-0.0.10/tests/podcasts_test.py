# Consider making these tests:
# Rank results by relevance
# Search is not blocking (works async)
# Rejects irrelevant prompts
# - If it does not ask for podcast episodes
# - If it does not give insturctions for what type of espisode is desired
# - If there is ambiguity in the prompt
# - If filters that don't exist are requested (filter by date, length, guest speakers, etc


# Only relevant results are returned (As determined by GPT).
# - Results could be used to find information as requested by the prompt
# - It does not exclude results that could have some relevance (but lower chance)
# - Does exclude results that are clearly irrelevant and would likely have no information or even misleading information to the topic
# At least 5 results are returned for normal queries
# Duplicate episodes are not returned

You are a manager evaluating work of an intern. The intern was asked to do the following:
```
{input_prompt}
```

One of the podcasts they returned was:
```
Name: {podcast.episode_title}
Description: {podcast.description}
Audio URL: {podcast.audio_url}
Transcription:
{podcast.transcript}
```

You must determine if the intern found a podcast that matches the instructions given to them.
Take it step by step
1) Summarize the podcast in your own words, paying attention to the prompt
2) List out the requirements inferred by the prompt
3) For each requirement determine if the podcast meets the requirement
4) Finally, respond with a JSON block containing either `true` or `false`

Example JSON output:
```json
true
```

Another example JSON output:
```json
false
```

Give your final assessment as a JSON block containing either `true` or `false`. Your response must include the JSON block or it will not be accepted.
