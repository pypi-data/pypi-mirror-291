MAgent2 is a library for the creation of environments where large numbers of pixel agents in a gridworld interact in battles or other competitive scenarios.

MAgent2 is a maintained fork of the original [MAgent](https://github.com/geek-ai/MAgent) codebase. It contains some [reference environments](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/MAgent2/tree/main/magent2/environments) implemented using the [PettingZoo](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/PettingZoo) API. These environments used to be included in PettingZoo itself, but have been moved here to exist independently. They are being regularly maintained and will receive bug fixes, support new versions of Python, etc. Development used to take place at [github.com/Farama-Foundation/MAgent](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/MAgent) but was moved to [github.com/Farama-Foundation/MAgent2](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/MAgent2) so that the distinction from the original MAgent library is clear to users.

## Installation
Install using pip: `pip install magent2`. See [docs](https://magent2.farama.org/) for usage information.


## Requirements
MAgent2 supports Linux and macOS and Python 3.8+.
