"""
A set of utility function related to natural language
processing. In addition to the basic libraries, the module
requires the following corpus from `nltk` library:
  * `stopwords` : used to remove stop words from a given
                  strings. Currently using the function for
                  pre-processing.

In addition, need some additional libraries like `fuzzywuzzy`
and `python-Levenshtein` using the following:

```python
pip install fuzzywuzzy
pip install python-Levenshtein
```

    A Simple Utility Function to Pre-Process a String

    The function inputs a string, and exports clean formatted string
    which is free of stop words (english) and the words are
    lemmatized, i.e. transformed to their base form.

    Calculate a Percentage Similarity between `string` and `reference` Text

    Using the `fuzzywuzzy.fuzz()` method, the function calculates the percentage of
    similarity between two text data. There are various methods available which can
    be declared via `method` parameter. However, `partial_ratio` is great when
    we want to match a text with partial data. For example, we want to find all the
    strings which have the word 'annonymous' but the spelling, position may be
    different in each case.

    Uses String Methods to Clean a String

    An extension of the `processor` function, which uses the in-built
    python string methods to clear string contents. The function can
    be called seperatly, or pass `text_process = True)` in `processor`.
    More information on in-built string methods is available here:
    https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/string.

    # ! Function is not yet optimized when used in conjunction.

    :type  string: str
    :param string: Base string which needs formatting. The string
                   is converted into lower case. If passed from
                   ! `processor`this step is repeated.
                   TODO fix when passed through parent function.
