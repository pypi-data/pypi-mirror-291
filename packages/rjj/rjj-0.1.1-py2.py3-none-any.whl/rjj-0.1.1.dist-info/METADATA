### jointer and splitter
joint or split your data file(s)
#### jointer
joint all csv files in the current directory together; all file names will be stored in the first field of the newly created column `File`; when you execute the command you will be asked for assigning a name for the output file
```
rjj j
```
#### splitter
split the selected csv file to different csv files and name it according to the value in the first field of that selected file
```
rjj s
```
#### xplit
split the selected excel (.xls or .xlsx) to pieces and name it according to the value in the first field of that selected excel
```
rjj x
```
#### joint
joint all excels (.xls and .xlsx) in the current directory together*; all file names will be stored in the first field of the newly created column `File`; when you execute the command you might be asked for assigning a name for the output file
```
rjj t
```
**differ from csv jointer, since both .xls and .xlsx is accepted, and the file extention will not be taken, it will be merged while two of them share the same file name (cannot be split by the command above); understand this condition, make good use of it!*
