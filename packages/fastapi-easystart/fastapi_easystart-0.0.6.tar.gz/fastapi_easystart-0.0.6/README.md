## Installation

You can install the fastapi-easystart package using either pip or pipenv:

```bash
pip install fastapi-easystart
```

## Quickstart

### 1. Initialize a New FastAPI Project
Begin by creating a new FastAPI project with the default settings and configurations. Run the following command:
```bash
python -m  fastapi_easystart.main init
```
This command will generate the basic project structure, including directories and initial files, based on the easy start template.

### 2. Configure the main.py File
After initializing your project, configure the main.py file to set up the FastAPI application. If you want to either override or merge the existing main.py file with a new configuration, use the following command:
```bash
python -m fastapi_easystart.main config-main
```

### 3. Running the Development Server
Once the project is set up, you can start the development server:
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Alternatively, you can use the FastAPI CLI command:

```bash
fastapi dev main.py
```
