    Base class for resource request objects. The request object forms part

    resource will be processed (the implementation of this functionality
    depends on what type of resource the request is being prepared for).
    Each resource can have an unlimited number of requests - it all depends
    on how the resource is logically divided and which parts of it are required by the user.

    Args:
        name (str): request name. Must be unique within a single resource.
        io_context (IOContext): I/O context instance. Specifies the actions that need to be performed with the data obtained as a
                                result of the request execution (in what format to deserialize, where to save, whether the information needs to be further processed, and so on).
        collect_interval (ActionCondition, optional): request activity interval. See ActionCondition for details. Defaults to AlwaysRun().
        has_pages (bool, optional): if True, then links to crawl the resource will be generated taking into account the paginator. Defaults to True.
