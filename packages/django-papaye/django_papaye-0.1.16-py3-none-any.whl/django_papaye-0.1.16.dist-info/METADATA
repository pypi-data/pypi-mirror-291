## [Description](#package-description)

django-papaye package configures your Django project in order to let you use Transcrypt into it the better way as
possible.

## [Usage](#usage)

#### In a Script - purely for development

Assuming you already created a Django project at '/path/to/your/django/project'
(if not please do so)

Before installing django-papaye you MUST first:

1) Install pyenv: https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv

2) Install a python3.9 version via pyenv:
```bash
pyenv install 3.9.19
```

3) In a new terminal tab, create a specific python virtual environment via pyenv:
```bash
cd /path/to/your/django/project  # go to you django project root folder (same folder where manage.py is)

pyenv shell 3.9.19  # switches to this specific version of python for this terminal tab until it's closed

python3 --version  # it should print out 'Python 3.9.19'

python3 -m venv venv-3.9

source venv-3.9/bin/activate  # to activate your venv-3.9
```

4) Install django-papaye:
```bash
pip install django-papaye
```

5) Then configure your django transcrypt environment by executing this command:
```bash
configure
```

6) Add a "load static" statement at top of base.html, then add a "script" calling your code transpiled from Python to Javascript just before the end of body tag:
```html
{% load static %}

<body>
    ...

    {# Transcrypted from .py to .js #}
    <script src="{% static 'js/main.js' %}"></script>
</body>
```

7) Start the Transcrypt Python2JS development server:
```bash
npm run devDesktop
```

8) Add the following code to t_logic/main.py:
```python
print('Hello from Transcrypt and django-papaye!')
```

9) Reload your browser with ctrl+shift+r, then open "inspect", then go "Console" tab and you should see the content of your print coded at previous step.

Your all good to go now! ü•≠

## [Installation](#installation)

Install the package with:
```pip install django-papaye```

## [System Requirements](#system-requirements)

django-papaye ü•≠ should work fine on Unix systems (Linux, MacOS).  

For Windows users, if you follow my guideline, it should be fine too.  
But if you encounter any issues, please leave me a message and I'll do my best to help you ASAP.

## [Testing](#testing)

Run tests on install by doing:
```pip3 install lib_off_campus_housing_parser --force --install-option test```
This will install the package, force the command line arguments to be installed, and run the tests
NOTE: You might need sudo to install command line arguments when doing this

You can test the package if in development by moving/cd into the directory where setup.py is located and running:
```python3 setup.py test```

To test a specific submodule, cd into that submodule and run:
```pytest```

Note: I currently have not written any tests, since I have tried the program and checked it's output by hand so I know
that it works. I know that this is not sufficient, but no one is going to use this thing but me so whatevs.

## [FAQ](#faq)

Q: Why this name: django-papaye ?

A1: Have you ever opened a 'papaye' ü•≠? 

It smells very bad! => like using Transcrypt inside Django at first

But then you start to taste it and now you are getting in love with it. Guess what, same for Transcrypt inside
Django

P.S.: Fruits 4 life üîÜüå±ü•≠üí™!
