    Deprecated
    ----------

    Start a new asynchronous AgentQL session with the given URL, web driver and user authentication session. By default, session will use Playwright Web Driver.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    url (str): URL to navigate session to. To navigate after a session has already started, users could start session with an initialized web driver and invoke `driver.open_url()` method.
    web_driver (webDriver) (optional): Web driver is responsible for interacting with the browser and page. Defaults to Playwright web driver, which is built on top of the [Playwright framework](https://playwright.dev/python/).
    user_auth_session (dict) (optional): The user authentication session that contains previous login session. Users could retrieve authentication session by starting a session, logging into desired website, and calling `session.get_user_auth_session()`, which will return a `auth_session` object defined in web driver.
    enable_history_log (bool) (optional): Enable history log to record all the events during the session, retrieved via `session.get_last_trail()`.

    Returns:
    -------
    Session: An instance of AgentQL Session class for asynchronous environment.
