# cpsms

## This is

A Python 3 wrapper around the SMS gateway from CPSMS <https://www.cpsms.dk/>.


## This is not

Some sort of magic, free SMS gateway.


## Installation

`cpsms` is available [from PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cpsms). Easiest
way to install is: `pip install cpsms`.


## Requirements

You need to have a (paid) account at CPSMS to be able to use their gateway.
They sell a fair, no-nonsense product which I'd recommend if you want to be
able to send SMS from your code (primarily to Danish phones).


## How to use

See a couple of example use cases in [example.py](./examples.py) that should
have come along with this file. Apart from what is shown in examples.py, this
also supports status callback URLs, delayed sending and flash messages.


## Further information

For more info on parameters, have a look at the
[CPSMS API documentation](https://www.cpsms.dk/login/index.php?page=dokumentation).

I believe the gateway software running at the CPSMS server is some sort of
standard product. This may be able to talk to other remote SMS gateways as
well, and that's why I made it an option to specify another gateway base
URL. If you know of any other compatible gateways, please let me know, and
I'll list them in the README.
