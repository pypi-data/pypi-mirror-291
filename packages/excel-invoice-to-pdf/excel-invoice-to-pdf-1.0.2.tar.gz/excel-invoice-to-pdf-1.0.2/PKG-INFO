## Example Usage
The `invoice` module contains a `generate` function that converts Excel invoices into PDF files. Here is how you can use it:
```python
from invoicing import invoice

invoice.generate(
    invoices_path="path_to_excel_invoices_folder",
    pdfs_path="path_to_output_pdfs_folder",
    logo_image_path="path_to_company_logo_image",
    product_id_col="Product ID",
    product_name_col="Product Name",
    amount_purchased_col="Amount Purchased",
    price_per_unit_col="Price per Unit",
    total_price_col="Total Price"
)
```

## Parameters
- `invoices_path`: The directory where Excel invoice files are stored.
- `pdfs_path`: The directory where the generated PDF invoices will be stored.
- `logo_image_path`: The path to the company logo image file to be included in the PDFs.
- `product_id_col`: The column name in the Excel files containing the product IDs.
- `product_name_col`: The column name in the Excel files containing the product names.
- `amount_purchased_col`: The column name in the Excel files containing the quantities of purchased products.
- `price_per_unit_col`: The column name in the Excel files containing the price per unit.
- `total_price_col`: The column name in the Excel files containing the total price of products.

The function will process all Excel files in the specified invoices_path, generate PDFs with the same names as the Excel files, and save them in the pdfs_path folder. If the pdfs_path directory does not exist, it will be created automatically.
