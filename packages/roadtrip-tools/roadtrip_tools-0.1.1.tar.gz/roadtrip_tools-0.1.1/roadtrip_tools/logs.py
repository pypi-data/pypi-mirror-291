    """
    Sets up logging consistently across modules
    when imported and run at the top of a module.


    Parameters
    ----------
    logger_name: str

    default_level: int, although recommended that you
        pass logging.<LEVEL> for consistency. If you want
        functions/classes/etc. within your module to log
        messages at a level other than the default INFO,
        set it here.

    filepath: str of the form 'path/to/log.log'.
        If not None, the contents of the log will be output to
        stderr (as is typical) *and* to the file specified. Note that the
        log's storage endpoint will be dictated by other parameters in this
        function, but defaults to local disk.

    align_all_loggers: bool. If True, will force all loggers called
        from other modules to use the configuration for this one.


    Returns
    -------
    Logger object.
