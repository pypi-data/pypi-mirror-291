# EasyWindcss

**EasyWindcss** is a Python script that simplifies the setup of Tailwind CSS in a Node.js project. It automates the process of initializing a Node.js project, installing Tailwind CSS, configuring Tailwind with user-defined content paths and file extensions, and generating the necessary HTML and CSS files for a modern, responsive website. Proven to be 6 times faster than manual setup!

## Features

- Initializes a new project.
- Installs Tailwind CSS and its CLI as development dependencies.
- Creates a basic Tailwind CSS configuration file (`tailwind.config.js`).
- Generates a CSS file with Tailwind's base, components, and utilities.
- Sets up an HTML file with a sample template to demonstrate Tailwind CSS.
- Adds build and watch scripts to `package.json` for easy development and deployment.
