This package is a wrapper around Stim that aims to help the construction of QEC-code circuits easier. The package implements model classes that help with inserting ciruit-level noise models. It uses a code layout that helps with qubit labeling, indexing and connectivity. Finally, there are a number of circuits for the rotated surface code that are implemented in the package.

For more information see the documentation in `docs/`.
