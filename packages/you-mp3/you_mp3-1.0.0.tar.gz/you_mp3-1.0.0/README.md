## Metadata

The tool automatically adds common basic metadata to all downloaded music

- **Release Date:** using the video release date as a base
- **Artist Name:** using the name of the channel that published the video as a base

Depending on the user, a text file to be the song's lyrics and arguments on the command line to represent the song's musical genres can also be added
