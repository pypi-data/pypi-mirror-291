This is an unofficial Python client for the public API of the World DanceSport Federation (WDSF).
Original documentation for the API can be found [here](https://github.com/jaykay-design/WDSF-API/).

The client is based on [Uplink](https://uplink.readthedocs.io) and uses [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev) for (de-)serialization and validation.

**This project is under active development.**
**Breaking changes must be expected for all `0.0.X` versions.**


## Installation and Usage

You can install this library from the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/wdsf-api/):

    pip install wdsf-api

You can then create a new client and make a request:

```{python}
from wdsf_api.client import WdsfApi

client = WdsfApi(
    environment='production',
    auth=('WDSF_API_USERNAME', 'WDSF_API_PASSWORD')
    )

competition = client.get_competition(competition_id=61243)
```

## Documentation

Coming. Will be published on [Read the Docs](https://wdsf-api-python-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
