## Description
Fraggler is for fragment analysis in Python!
Fraggler is a Python package that provides functionality for analyzing and generating reports for fsa files. It offers both a Python API and a command-line tool.

----------------

## Install

```bash
pip install fraggler
```

### Dependencies
Fraggler depends on:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- lmfit
- scipy
- biopython
- panel
- altair

## Python API

To get an overview how the library can be used in a python environment, please look at the [tutorial.ipynb](demo/tutorial.ipynb).


## CLI

#### Usage
To generate peak area reports and a peak table for all input files, use the `fraggler -t area` or `fraggler -t peak` command followed by the required arguments and any optional flags.

```bash
usage: fraggler [-h] -t {area,peak} -f FSA -o OUTPUT -l {LIZ,ROX,ORANGE,ROX500} -sc SAMPLE_CHANNEL
                 [-min_dist MIN_DISTANCE_BETWEEN_PEAKS] [-min_s_height MIN_SIZE_STANDARD_HEIGHT]
                 [-cp CUSTOM_PEAKS] [-height_sample PEAK_HEIGHT_SAMPLE_DATA]
                 [-min_ratio MIN_RATIO_TO_ALLOW_PEAK] [-distance DISTANCE_BETWEEN_ASSAYS]
                 [-peak_start SEARCH_PEAKS_START] [-m {gauss,voigt,lorentzian}]

```

##### Example of CLI command:
```bash
fraggler -t area -f demo/ -o testing_fraggler -l LIZ -sc DATA1
```

#### Peak finding
- If not specified, fraggler finds peaks agnostic in the `fsa file`. To specifiy custom assays with certain peaks and intervals, the user can add a .csv file to the `--custom_peaks` argument. The csv file **MUST** have the following shape:

| name | start | stop | amount | min_ratio | which | peak_distance |
|------|-------|------|--------|-----------|-------|---------------|
| prt1 | 140   | 150  | 2      | 0.2       | FIRST | 5             |

##### Example how how a file could look:
```txt 
name,start,stop,amount,min_ratio,which,peak_distance
prt1,135,155,2,0.2,FIRST,
prt3,190,205,,0.2,FIRST,
prt2,222,236,2,0.2,FIRST,5
prt4,262,290,5,,,
```

- `name`: Name of the assay
- `start`: Start of the assay in basepairs
- `stop`: Stop of the assay in basepairs
- `amount`: Optional. Amount of peaks in assay. If left empty every peak in the interval is included. 
- `min_ratio`: Optional. Only peaks with the a ratio of the `min_ratio` of the highest peak is included, *e.g.* if `min_ratio == .02`, only peaks with a height of 20 is included, if the highest peak is 100 units
- `which`: *LARGEST | FIRST*. Can be left empty. Which peak should be included if there are more peaks than the `amount`. if *FIRST* is set, then the two first peaks are chosen. If *LARGEST* are set, then the two largests peaks in the area are chosen. Defaults to *LARGEST*
- `peak_distance`: Optional. Distance between peaks must be ***under*** this value.
