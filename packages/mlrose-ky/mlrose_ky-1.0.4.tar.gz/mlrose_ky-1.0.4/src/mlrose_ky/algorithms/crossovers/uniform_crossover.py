"""Uniform Crossover implementation for Genetic Algorithms (GA).

This module defines a uniform crossover operation used in genetic algorithms,
where each gene in the offspring is chosen randomly from one of the corresponding
genes of the parents.

    Uniform crossover for genetic algorithms.

    This class implements a uniform crossover operation where each gene of the offspring
    is independently chosen from one of the two parents with equal probability. This
    method is often used when no prior knowledge about the problem structure is known.
