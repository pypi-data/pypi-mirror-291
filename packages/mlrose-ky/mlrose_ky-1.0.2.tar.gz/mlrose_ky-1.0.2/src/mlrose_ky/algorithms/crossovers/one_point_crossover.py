    One-point crossover for genetic algorithms.

    This class implements a simple one-point crossover, where a single crossover

        Perform the one-point crossover between two parent sequences to produce offspring.

        A single crossover point is selected randomly from the chromosome. All genes before

        ----------

            The first parent chromosome sequence.
