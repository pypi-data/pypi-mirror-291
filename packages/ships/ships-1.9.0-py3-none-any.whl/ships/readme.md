Make sure the git repository doesn't have any changes before   
running this, in the event that there is a problem.  

Itinerary: add "exclude_paths".   
    
Caution: Make sure there aren't any image or video files in the path.   
   
```
import ships.paths.directory.find_and_replace_string_v2 as find_and_replace_string_v2

import pathlib
from os.path import dirname, join, normpath
this_folder = pathlib.Path (__file__).parent.resolve ()
find_and_replace_string_v2.start (
	the_path = str (this_folder) + "/DB",

	find = 'region 1',
	replace_with = 'region one',
	
	replace_contents = "yes",
	replace_paths = "yes"
)
```

## simultaneous_v2
```
from ships.flow.simultaneous_v2 import simultaneously_v2
import time

def move (item):
	print ("starting", item)
	
	time.sleep (item)
	result = f"Processed item: {item}"
	print (result)
	
	return result


proceeds = simultaneously_v2 (
	items = [3.5, 1, 2, 1.1, 4, 1.11, 1.12, 1.13],
	capacity = 4,
	move = move
)
