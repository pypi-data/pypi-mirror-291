# Agustinus' _Very_ Opiniated Publication-Ready Plotting Library

I love TikZ (btw). I love [tikzplotlib](https://github.com/nschloe/tikzplotlib). I've been an
advocate for the latter ([proof](https://agustinus.kristia.de/blog/plotting/)). However, tikzplotlib is [as good as dead](https://github.com/nschloe/tikzplotlib/commits/main/). I need to move on.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Here's what I use now for all my publication needs. This library is designed to be
> _*very*_ opiniated. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Also, it is _very_ simple,
> just a single file and that's it.

> [!NOTE]
> Of course I still use TikZ whenever possible (e.g. Fig. 1 in a paper, diagrams, etc.)

## Examples

**Left:** ICML (letter size), single-column layout. **Right:** A0 landscape poster, 3-column layout.

<div align="center">
    <img src="imgs/example_paper.png" width="40%"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <img src="imgs/example_poster.png" width="43.7%">
</div>

<br />

```diff
import pub_ready_plots

...

pub_ready_plots.get_context(
    ...
-   layout="icml",
+   layout="poster-landscape",
    ...
)

...
```

## Installation

Still with me? Still want to use this library? Here's how:

```bash
pip install pub-ready-plots
```

## Quick Usage

```python
import pub_ready_plots

with pub_ready_plots.get_context(
    width_frac=1,  # between 0 and 1
    height_frac=0.15,  # between 0 and 1
    layout="icml",  # or "iclr", "neurips", "poster-portrait", "poster-landscape"
    single_col=False,  # only works for the "icml" layout
    nrows=1,  # depending on your subplots, default = 1
    ncols=2,  # depending on your subplots, default = 1
    sharey=True,  # Additional keyword args for `plt.subplots`
    override_rc_params={"lines.linewidth": 4.123}  # Overriding rcParams
) as (fig, axs):
    # Do whatever you want with `fig` and `axs`
    ...

    # Once your done, save it, but do NOT set `tight_layout=True`!
    fig.savefig("filename.pdf")
```

Then in your LaTeX file, include the plot as follows:

```tex
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{filename.pdf}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The argument `width=\linewidth` is **crucial**!

That's it! But you should use TikZ more.
Anyway, see the full, runnable example in [`examples/simple_plot.py`](https://github.com/wiseodd/pub-ready-plots/blob/master/examples/simple_plot.py)

> [!TIP]
> I recommend using this library in conjunction with
> [pypalettes]<https://github.com/JosephBARBIERDARNAL/pypalettes>
> to avoid the generic blue-orange Matplotlib colors.
> Distinguish your plots from others!

## Using your own styles

Two options:

1. Use this library and update the resulting `rc_params` dict with your styles.
   - See [`examples/advanced_usage.py`](https://github.com/wiseodd/pub-ready-plots/blob/master/examples/advanced_usage.py)
2. Fork this repo and modify things as you wish.

## Other libraries

Check out [tueplots](https://github.com/pnkraemer/tueplots) if you want a more complex
library. My library is designed to achieve what **_I_** want in **_my_** papers and
posters, with as little code as possible. Because of this, it is very forkable and hackable.
