This is a library that is accosiated with numbers. This makes calculating in Python easier.
Te dSeq function creates and returns the Doubling Sequence up to the number given.
The sqrt function is Square Root.
The area function takes in 2 shapes. Rectangle, Triangle. Square, Parralelogram and Rhombus fall into the Rectangle catagory. The shape name should be lowercase. 
Here is an example to use the Calculator class.

calc = Calculator()
print(calc.calculate("18 - 9"))

where calc is a variable and the string statement is the expression (BIDMAS is accepted in the string expression). Just remember, if the Calculator class doesn't work, install sympy with command: pip install sympy
I hope you use this library and it helps you.
