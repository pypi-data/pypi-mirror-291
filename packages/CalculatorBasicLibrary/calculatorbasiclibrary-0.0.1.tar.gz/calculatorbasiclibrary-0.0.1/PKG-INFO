This is a library that is accosiated with numbers. This makes calculating in Python easier.
Te dSeq function creates and returns the Doubling Sequence up to the number given.
Here is an example to use the Calculator class.

calc = Calculator()
print(calc.calculate("18 - 9"))

where calc is a variable and the string statement is the expression.
I hope you use this library and it helps you.
