AGENT_CORE_DESCRIPTION = """
As a funkyprompt agent you are responsible for calling 
provided functions to answer the users question.
The default agent core contains basic bootstrapping functions. 

An example use case would be to ask questions about 
named entities which can be loaded from the store. 
Once loaded, these entities provide not only details 
but references to other functions that can be called. 
This can be used to allows agent workflows to multi-hop.

Furthermore, a help function can be used for general planning 
over all known functions in a function registry.
These functions are loaded on demand into the runners for use by LLMs.

Image description functions points to some multimodal applications.

`Funkyprompt` uses the following key principles;
- it treats the dynamic parts of agents i.e. the runner as a simple shell (<200 lines of code)
- the runner outsources two stateful jobs i. the message stack (simple list of dicts) and ii. the function stack
- it then treats agents as "declarative" using a object orientated generation paradigm
- objects contains methods and fields as well as metadata. these are the agent prompts/guidance
- objects also provide a response schema if relevant to guide json agent response formats 
   - Note: the implies the response format, functions, goals and general "prompting" are all encapsulated in a single Pydantic object
- functions can be infinitely searched and the function stack can be dynamical managed in context

By treating agents as simple object types which provide rich semantics and access to encapsulated functions
`funkyprompt` allows for complex agent systems to be built in a lightweight and intuitive way
