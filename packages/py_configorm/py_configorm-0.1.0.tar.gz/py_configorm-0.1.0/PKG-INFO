# Configuration ORM for Python applications

![Test Status](https://github.com/onexay/py-configorm/actions/workflows/python-package.yml/badge.svg)

A python library which provides ORM like semantics to application configuration. At present, it provides the expected functionality but requires some more work in terms of error handling. 

The library works on the concept of configuration sources. Currently following sources are supported, 

* [TOML](sources/toml.md)
* [JSON](sources/json.md)
* [YAML](sources/yaml.md)
* [DotEnv](sources/dotenv.md)
* [Environment Variables](sources/env.md)

User defines a application settings schema by subclassing from [ConfigSchema](core.md) class. User can choose one or more configuration sources to create a Pydantic object based on application configuration schema.

Library will then try to read from all provided configuration sources and merge them to build the pydantic application configuration object.

## Important Note

Name of keys in configuration sources and confguration schema MUST match. It would have been nice to decouple two, but for the intended functionality, it's a minor enhancement.

Configuration sources are provided as a list of objects and precedence and priority of sources is determined by ordering of the sources in the list, e.g. first source in the list has lowest precendence, last one has the highest.

## Read-Write Capability

If the configuration supports, library provides ability to save functionality for the application configuration object. By default, write capability is disabled.

| Configuration Source | Read | Read-Write |
|--|--|--|
| `TOML` | Yes | Yes |
| `JSON` | Yes | Yes |
| `YAML` | Yes | Yes |
| `DotEnv` | Yes | No |
| `Environment Variable` | Yes | Yes |

## Example

### Using JSON

```json
{
    "Service": {
        "Host": "localhost",
        "Port": 18080
    },
}
```

### Using TOML
```toml
[Service]
Host = "localhost",
Port = 18080
```

### Using YAML
```yaml
Service:
    Host: "localhost"
    Port: 18080
```

### Using DotEnv files / Environment variables
```env
CFGORM_SERVICE__HOST=localhost
CFGORM_SERVICE__PORT=8080
```

```python

class TestServiceConfig(BaseModel):
    Host: str = Field(..., description="Host running the service")
    Port: int = Field(..., description="Port bound to the service")


class TestConfig(ConfigSchema):
    Service: TestServiceConfig = Field(..., description="Service configuration")

json_source = JSONSource(file_path=Path(config_file_json))

cfg_orm = ConfigORM(schema=TestConfig, sources=[json_source])

cfg: TestConfig = cfg_orm.load_config()

print(cfg)

```
