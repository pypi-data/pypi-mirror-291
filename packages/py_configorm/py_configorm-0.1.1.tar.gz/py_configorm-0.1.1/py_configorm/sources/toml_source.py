"""
This module contains the TOMLSource class, a class for a TOML configuration
source.

TOML (Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language) is a minimal configuration file format
that is easy to read due to obvious semantics.

This module is part of the `configorm` package for handling configuration data.

    Class for a TOML configuration source.

    This class is a subclass of `SourceBase` and represents a TOML configuration
    source. It provides methods to load and save configuration data from/to a
    TOML file.

    Attributes:
        _file_path (Path): The path to the TOML configuration file.

    Methods:
        __init__(self, file_path: Path, readonly: bool = True):
            Initializes a new instance of `TOMLSource`.

        load(self) -> dict:
            Load configuration data from this source.

            Returns:
                dict: The loaded configuration data.

        save(self, data: dict):
            Save configuration data to this source.

            Args:
                data (dict): The configuration data to save.

        reload(self):
            Reload configuration data from this source.

            This method is called when the application is reloaded and the
            configuration data must be reloaded from the source.
