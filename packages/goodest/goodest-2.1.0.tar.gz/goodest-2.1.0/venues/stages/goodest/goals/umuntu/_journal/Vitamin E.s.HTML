	<h1>Vitamin E</h1>	


	<h2>summary</h2>
		
		One mg vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) is equivalent
		1 mg RRR-alpha-tocopherol 
		2 mg all rac-alpha-tocopherol. 
		
		Because insufficient data are available 
		to develop RDAs for infants, 
		
		AIs were developed based on the amount of 
		vitamin E consumed by healthy breastfed babies.
