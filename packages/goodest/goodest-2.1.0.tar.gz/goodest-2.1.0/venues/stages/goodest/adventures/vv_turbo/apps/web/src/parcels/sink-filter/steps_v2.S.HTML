			1. 	Put on thick mechanic gloves, like https://amzn.to/4bKX4k6.
			
			2. 	Assume that there are batteries and a completelly sentient 
				consciousness built into the spinning knife contraption.
			
			3.	Try to remove any power inputs that are connected to the
				contraption.
			
			4. 	Check the instruction book or consult Youtube videos on
				how to remove the species of spinning knife contraption
				that you identify.
