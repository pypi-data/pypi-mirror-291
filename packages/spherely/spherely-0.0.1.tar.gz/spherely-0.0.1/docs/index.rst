Spherely Documentation
======================

Manipulation and analysis of geometric objects on the sphere.

Spherely is the counterpart of `Shapely`_ (2.0+) for manipulation and analysis
of spherical geometric objects. It is using the widely deployed open-source
geometry library `s2geometry`_ via the library `s2geography`_ which provides a
`GEOS`_ compatibility layer on top of s2geometry.

This library is at an early stage of development.
