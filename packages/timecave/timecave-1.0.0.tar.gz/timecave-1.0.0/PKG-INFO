              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# Welcome to TimeCaVe :chart_with_upwards_trend:

TimeCaVe is a Python package that provides off-the-shelf model validation methods for time series modelling tasks.
These methods were conceived with time series forecasting in mind, though, in principle, they could also be applied to other time series related tasks.

The methods' generic implementation is flexible enough for them to be used with **ANY** kind of time series model, including classical time series forecasting 
models (e.g. AR models), classical machine learning models (e.g. decision trees) and deep learning models specifically tailored to handle sequence data (e.g. LSTMs).

In addition to the validation methods themselves, TimeCaVe provides several utility functions and classes. These include specific metrics to measure the performance of a validation method, data generation methods, functions to aid in the data collection process, and functions to extract important features from the data.

# Features

- **Versatility**: Our flexible, generic implementations are able to accomodate a wide variety of time series forecasting models.
- **Scikit-learn-like syntax**: TimeCaVe's validation methods are implemented in a similar way to those of Scikit-learn, thereby smoothing the learning curve.
- **Extra functionality**: In addition to splitting your data, TimeCaVe allows you to plot your partitioned data, compute relevant statistics for all training and validation sets, and access information regarding how much data is being used for training and validation. All this to ensure you make the best possible use of your data.
- **Data generation**: Generate synthetic time series data easily with TimeCaVe's data generation capabilities.
- **Validation metrics**: Several metrics are provided to help you select the most appropriate validation method, if need be.
- **Data collection**: TimeCaVe provides utility functions that can help determine the necessary amount of samples to capture a given dominant frequency.

# Installation

## Using pip

TimeCaVe can be directly installed from PyPi using pip:

```
pip install timecave
```

To install the development version, simply type:

```
pip install "timecave[dev]"
```

This will install dependencies that have been used to develop TimeCaVe and its documentation, such as Black and MKDocs.

## Using git

TimeCaVe can also be installed using git. To do so, clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/MiguelLoureiro98/timecave.git
```

Then, move into the cloned repository and install the package using pip:

```
cd timecave
pip install .
```

Again, to install development dependencies, simply type:

```
pip install ".[dev]"
```

# Basic Usage

TimeCaVe is, above all else, built to provide easy-to-use validation methods for time series forecasting models. The syntax is relatively similar to that of the methods provided by Scikit-learn (e.g. K-fold). Here is an example of how to use one of the methods provided by this package (Block Cross-Validation):

```py
import numpy as np
from timecave.validation_methods.CV import BlockCV

ts = np.arange(0, 10)

# Split the data into 5 folds
splitter = BlockCV(5, ts);

for train, test, _ in splitter.split():

    training_data = ts[train];
    validation_data = ts[test];

    # Train and validate your model
```

Methods to plot the partitioned time series and compute relevant statistics are also provided. 

For more information on how to use the package, check TimeCaVe's [documentation](https://miguelloureiro98.github.io/timecave/).

# Authors
The package was developed by Beatriz Louren√ßo and Miguel Loureiro, two graduate research assistants at [IST](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/), University of Lisbon, Portugal.
