# bored-charts

Build easy, minimal, PDF-able data reports with markdown and python.

The idea is you do your analysis in Python, as you normally would, and dumping your
figures into a nice report written in markdown is now super low-effort: you decorate
the function to generate the figure (that you already wrote when doing your analysis)
and it becomes available to bored-charts so you can present your findings clearly.

## Minimal example

Install bored-charts and uvicorn:

```bash
pip install bored-charts uvicorn
```

### Create your app

```python
# main.py
from pathlib import Path

import plotly.express as px
from boredcharts import BCRouter, boredcharts
from boredcharts.jinja import to_html
from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse

pages = Path(__file__).parent.absolute() / "pages"
figure_router = BCRouter()


@figure_router.chart("usa_population")
async def usa_population() -> HTMLResponse:
    df = px.data.gapminder().query("country=='United States'")
    fig = px.bar(df, x="year", y="pop")
    return HTMLResponse(to_html(fig))


app = boredcharts(
    pages=pages,
    figure_router=figure_router,
)
```

### Write a markdown report

pages/populations.md:

```md
## Populations

USA's population has been growing linearly for the last 70 years:

{{ figure("usa_population") }}
```

### Run your app

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

🎉Now you can view your reports at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)!

## Going further

A more full project structure might look like this:

```
my-reports
├── myreports
│   ├── pages           <-- put your markdown reports here
│   │   └── example.md
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── app.py          <-- spin up the app here
│   └── figures.py      <-- define your figures here
├── README.md
└── pyproject.toml
```

## Extensibility

The bored-charts app is just a FastAPI (ASGI) app,
so you can integrate it into your existing projects or extend it as needed.
