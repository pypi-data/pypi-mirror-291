    """
    Compare R-Squared and Adjusted R-Squared values for each model and generate a summary table
    with the results.

    **Purpose**: The purpose of this function is to compare the R-Squared and Adjusted R-Squared values for different models applied to various datasets.

    **Test Mechanism**: The function iterates through each dataset-model pair, calculates the R-Squared and Adjusted R-Squared values, and generates a summary table with these results.

    **Signs of High Risk**:
    - If the R-Squared values are significantly low, it could indicate that the model is not explaining much of the variability in the dataset.
    - A significant difference between R-Squared and Adjusted R-Squared values might indicate that the model includes irrelevant features.

    **Strengths**:
    - Provides a quantitative measure of model performance in terms of variance explained.
    - Adjusted R-Squared accounts for the number of predictors, making it a more reliable measure when comparing models with different numbers of features.

    **Limitations**:
    - Assumes that the dataset is provided as a DataFrameDataset object with `y`, `y_pred`, and `feature_columns` attributes.
    - The function relies on `adj_r2_score` from the `statsmodels.statsutils` module, which should be correctly implemented and imported.
    - Requires that `dataset.y_pred(model)` returns the predicted values for the model.
