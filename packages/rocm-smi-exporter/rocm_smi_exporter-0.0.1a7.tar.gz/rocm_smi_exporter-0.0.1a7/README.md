# rocm-smi-exporter

Export rocm-smi metrics as prometheus metrics

## Install

```
# Public Pypi package
pip install rocm-smi-exporter==0.0.1a6

# Private Docker image
powerml/rocm-smi-exporter:0.0.1a6
```

## Known issues

### On K8s, exporter cannot be deployed as sidecar of a Pod requesting GPUs

When this exporter is deployed as a sidecar container of a pod that requests AMD GPUs,
the exporter sidecar has no access to the GPUs (which are accessible to the other containers).

[ROCm/k8s-device-plugin](https://github.com/ROCm/k8s-device-plugin)
is used to manage AMD GPUs on K8s, we suspect its setup confuses `librocm_smi64.so`,
which is used by this exporter to collect metrics.

## Working secnarios

### Deploy exporter as systemd service for infrastructure monitoring

See [systemd](systemd)

### Call exporter API directly in your python application

You can invoke the GPU metrics exporting code inside your python application.
And use the scraping configuration as follows.

## Docker

```
docker build . -t powerml/rocm-smi-exporter

# Login with powerml repo in 1password and push to it
docker login
docker push powerml/rocm-smi-exporter

# -v /opt:/opt is needed to make rocm runtime library available to container
docker run -d --rm --name=smi-exporter -p 9001:9001 \
--device=/dev/kfd --device=/dev/dri --group-add video \
-v /opt:/opt powerml/rocm-smi-exporter

# You should see the ROCM_* prefixed metrics
curl localhost:9001/metrics
```

## Integration with kube-prometheus-stack

**NOTE**: `powerml/rocm-smi-exporter:0.0.1a6` is a private image, you may need to build your own image from the pip package.

Assume there is already a
[kube-prometheus-stack](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack)
deployment on your kubernetes cluster. Verify that with:

```
helm list -n <namespace-of-kube-prometheus-stack>
```

### Deploy exporter sidecar container

NOTE: You'll need to have the imagePullSecret to be able to pull `powerml/rocm-smi-exporter`.

First, you'll need to deploy the exporter as `sidecar` container to your pods that request AMD GPUs.
Use the template below. You'll need to add:
* `rocm-smi-exporter-sidecar` to your pod's `containers` section
* `host-opt` to your pod's `volumes` section
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: {{ pod-name }}
  labels:
    exporter: rocm-smi
spec:
  containers:
  - name: {{ main-container-name }}
    image: {{ main-image }}
    resources:
      limits:
        amd.com/gpu: {{ count }}
  # Add the following sidecar container to your pod
  - name: rocm-smi-exporter-sidecar
    image: powerml/rocm-smi-exporter
    # This port must be same as the promPort
    args: ["lamini-rocm-smi-exporter", "--port=9001"]
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    ports:
    - containerPort: 9001
      name: prometheus
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /opt
      name: host-opt
  volumes:
  # Add additional volumen for sidecar container
  - name: host-opt
    hostPath:
      # This is ROCm installation directory
      path: /opt
      type: Directory
```

### Upgrade kube-prometheus-stack helm values to pick up metrics from the sidecar

In your `kube-prometheus-stack`'s values.yaml file, add the following `rocm-smi-exporter` to the
`prometheus.prometheusSpec.additionalScrapeConfigs` section. You can the location in the [example of official repo](
https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/blob/847789a719d91dd13d30a6e9eaa530af897e3276/charts/kube-prometheus-stack/values.yaml#L3843).
An example is provided below.
```
# This is a sample configuration.
# Save this to values.yaml and upgrade with helm.
prometheus:
  prometheusSpec:
    additionalScrapeConfigs:
      - job_name: rocm-smi-exporter
        scrape_interval: 1s
        metrics_path: /metrics
        scheme: http
        kubernetes_sd_configs:
        - role: pod
        relabel_configs:
        - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_label_exporter]
          action: keep
          regex: rocm-smi
        - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_name]
          target_label: pod
        - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_namespace]
          target_label: namespace
        - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_node_name]
          target_label: node
        - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_ip]
          target_label: instance
```

Save the above yaml to `values.yaml` and upgrade your own helm release.
```
helm list -n <namespace>
```
You'll see the output like below:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a71fce1a-d4cc-4568-8839-be68fa08ee60)
Note down the release name and version, here they are `prometheus` and `61.3.0`.

Then upgrade the release with the command below:
```
helm upgrade <release-name> prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack -f values.yaml --version <version>
```

### Verify in Grafana

Open Grafana, click `Explore -> Prometheus -> Select Metric -> ROCM_*`, you should see the captured metrics:
```
METRIC_GPU_UTIL = "ROCM_SMI_DEV_GPU_UTIL"
METRIC_GPU_MEM_TOTAL = "ROCM_SMI_DEV_GPU_MEM_TOTAL"
METRIC_GPU_MEM_USED = "ROCM_SMI_DEV_GPU_MEM_USED"
METRIC_GPU_MEM_UTIL = "ROCM_SMI_DEV_MEM_UTIL"
METRIC_GPU_POWER = "ROCM_SMI_DEV_POWER"
METRIC_GPU_CU_OCCUPANCY = "ROCM_SMI_DEV_CU_OCCUPANCY"
```

You can import [GPUs](GPUs_Grafana.json) Grafana Dashboard into your Grafana.

## Extra

* [Add args to systemd service](https://superuser.com/a/728962)
  * The python code accepts `--port` and other arguments
  * If needed, set its value when launching systemd service
