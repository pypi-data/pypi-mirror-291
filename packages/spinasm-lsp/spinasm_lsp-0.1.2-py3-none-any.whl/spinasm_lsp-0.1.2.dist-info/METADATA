[![Python versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/spinasm-lsp.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/spinasm-lsp)

A Language Server Protocol (LSP) server to provide language support for the [SPINAsm assembly language](http://www.spinsemi.com/Products/datasheets/spn1001-dev/SPINAsmUserManual.pdf). The LSP is built on an extended version of the [asfv1](https://github.com/ndf-zz/asfv1) parser.

## Features

- **Diagnostics**: Reports the location of syntax errors and warnings.
- **Signature help**: Shows parameter hints as instructions are entered.
- **Hover**: Shows documentation and assigned values on hover.
- **Completion**: Provides suggestions for opcodes, labels, and variables.
- **Renaming**: Renames matching labels or variables.
- **Go to definition**: Jumps to the definition of a label, memory address, or variable.
- **Semantic highlighting**: Color codes variables, constants, instructions, etc. based on program semantics.
