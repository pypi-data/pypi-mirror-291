- Skip existing files to avoid redundant downloads
- Remove temporary files created during the download process
- Configurable options for version, voice, and output directory

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- yt-dlp
- requests

## Installation

```bash
pip install --upgrade audio_bible_tools
```

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use the YouTubeDownloader class:

```python
from audio_bible_tools import YouTubeDownloader 
root_dir = '/content/drive/My Drive/'
project_dir = 'kjv_audio'
channel_handle = 'skiesaboveus'
genesis_playlist = "01 Genesis Chapters 01-50 (KJV)"
revelation_playlist = "66 Revelation Chapters 01-22 (KJV)"

# Initialize the downloader
downloader = YouTubeDownloader(
    root_dir=root_dir,
    channel_handle=channel_handle,
    project_dir=project_dir,
    genesis_playlist=genesis_playlist,
    revelation_playlist=revelation_playlist
)

# Remove any temporary files
downloader.remove_tmp_files()

# Print the total number of files in the project directory
# print(downloader.count_files_in_directory())

downloader.list_and_process_playlists()

# Remove temporary files again after download
downloader.remove_tmp_files()

# Process the downloaded files
downloader.version("kjv") \
    .voice("kjv-audio-bible") \
    .result_dir("bible_audio_processed") \
    .chapterPattern("Chapter (\d+)") \
    .process()
```

```python
from audio_bible_tools import YouTubeDownloader 

root_dir = '/content/drive/My Drive/'
project_dir = 'kjv_audio_1'
channel_handle = 'ScourbyYouBible'
genesis_playlist = "1 ~ Book of Genesis by the Chapter"
revelation_playlist = "66 ~ Book of Revelation by the Chapter"

# Initialize the downloader
downloader = YouTubeDownloader(
    root_dir=root_dir,
    channel_handle=channel_handle,
    project_dir=project_dir,
    genesis_playlist=genesis_playlist,
    revelation_playlist=revelation_playlist
)

# Remove any temporary files
downloader.remove_tmp_files()

# Print the total number of files in the project directory
# print(downloader.count_files_in_directory())

downloader.list_and_process_playlists()

# Remove temporary files again after download
downloader.remove_tmp_files()

# Process the downloaded files
downloader.version("kjv") \
    .voice("scourby") \
    .result_dir("bible_audio_processed") \
    .chapterPattern("(\d+)\s+of\s+\d+\s+Chapters") \
    .process()
```
