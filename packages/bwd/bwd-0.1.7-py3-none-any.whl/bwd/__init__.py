"""
Module level documentation for the Balancing Walk Design.

This package is a truly minimal implementation in Python with 
only a dependency on numpy. There are only two classes implemented
in this package:

- [`BWD`](bwd) - The Balancing Walk Design with restarts of the algorithm.
- [`BWDRandom`](bwd_random) - The Balancing Walk Design which reverts to simple randomization
rather than restarting.
