.. py:class:: NegativeMSELikelihood(system_matrix, projections = None, additive_term = None, scaling_constant = 1.0)

   Bases: :py:obj:`pytomography.likelihoods.likelihood.Likelihood`

   Negative mean squared error likelihood function :math:`L(g|f) = -\frac{1}{2} \alpha \sum_i \left(g_i-(Hf)_i\right)^2` where :math:`g` is the acquired data, :math:`H` is the system matrix, :math:`f` is the object being reconstructed, and :math:`\alpha` is the scaling constant. The negative is taken so that the it works in gradient ascent (as opposed to descent) algorithms

   :type system_matrix: SystemMatrix
   :param projections: Acquired data
   :type projections: torch.Tensor
   :param additive_term: Additional term added after forward projection by the system matrix. This term might include things like scatter and randoms. Defaults to None.
   :type additive_term: torch.Tensor, optional
   :param additive_term_variance_estimate: Variance estimate of the additive term. If none, then uncertainty estimation does not include contribution from the additive term. Defaults to None.

      :param object: Object :math:`f` on which the likelihood is computed
