## Notices

### Importing

There's a class called "input" so if you import this package using "from StefanTools import *" you'll lose the ability to use "input()", in that file.

Instead, ALWAYS import this using "import StefanTools".

## Maintaining

This package is a package created for my personal use so don't expect any updating or maintaining unless I need it or feel like it.
