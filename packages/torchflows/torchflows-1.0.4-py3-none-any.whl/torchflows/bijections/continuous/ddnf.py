    """
    Base bijection for the DDNF model.
    Note that this model is implemented WITHOUT Geodesic regularization.
    This is because torchdiffeq ODE solvers do not output the predicted velocity, only the point.
    While the paper presents DDNF as a continuous normalizing flow, it is easier implement as a Residual normalizing
        flow in this library.

    IMPORTANT NOTE: the Euler solver prouduces very inaccurate results. Switching to the DOPRI5 solver massively
    improves reconstruction quality. However, we leave the Euler solver as it is presented in the original method.
