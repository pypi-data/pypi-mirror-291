AFQ-browser is a software library for visualization of results from
automated fiber quantification of human brain tractography.

The software takes as input the results of analysis from the ``AFQ`` or
``pyAFQ`` software and produces a browser-based visualization of the data.
Command-line tools allow users to create these visualizations from their data
and upload them to share with others as a website.
