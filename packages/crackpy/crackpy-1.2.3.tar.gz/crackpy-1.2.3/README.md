The methodology for fatigue crack growth (fcg) experiments has not changed for decades and usually still relies on the concept that a 
theoretical stress intensity factor is calculated with respect to a standardized specimen geometry, applied load, 
and projected crack length measured by integral methods like direct current potential drop [**1**]. Such conventional fcg 
experiments are time-consuming and therefore very expensive. On the other hand, these experiments only result in 
a single material curve, i.e. a-N, which is hard to reproduce even under identical testing conditions. 
Consequently, the experimental outcome-to-cost ratio is relatively low. 

Digital image correlation (DIC) has become a state-of-the-art tool to increase the insight in experimental mechanics due to its 
wide availability, and the possibility to gain full field information (displacements and strains) fully automatically. In particular, it is 
well-suited to analyze (fatigue) cracks [**2, 3**]. 

This Python package provides a pipeline, which takes an arbitrary number of DIC or simulation results and calculates various 
fracture mechanical parameters.

| **_Schematic overview of data flow in CrackPy_** |

To do so, we use a specific DIC data format which is stored as a "_Nodemap_".txt text file. 
This file contains the nodal full-field displacement and strain data as well as information about the 
experiment and metadata. For every single file (referring to one time step of the experiment), the crack 
tip location and crack path geometry is detected using a trained artificial neural network [**4**]. After that, 
the crack tip information together with the displacements and strains are used by our fracture analysis module. 
This module contains a pipeline that computes stress intensity factors based on J-, interaction, and conjugate-work integrals, 
fits the Williams expansion to calculate arbitrary Williams series coefficients or fits the CJP model to calculate 
stress intensity factors which take effects of plasticity into account.
   
## Scope of the Package

The following graph shows an overview over the main CrackPy modules **structure elements**, **dic**, **simulation**, **crack detection**, and 
**fracture analysis**.

| **_Overview of main modules, functions and files in CrackPy_** |

The structure element module provides classes for any structural elements like _experiment_ or 
_data file_. Most of these are currently just placeholders to add functionality later on. However, a very important structural element is the _Material_ class containing information about the
material law (elastic & shear moduli, stiffness matrix, etc.) as well as the _Nodemap_ class, containing information about the data structure of the nodemap.
We provide two modules, i.e. **dic** and **simulation**, which feature utilities to generate nodemaps from a 
specific software. Therefore, these modules can only be used if CrackPy is installed on an Aramis system equipped with 
an actual GOM Aramis Professional software >v2020 (in case of **dic**) or if a valid version and license of Ansys is available 
(in case of **simulation**). For more details, we refer to our Wiki. Once you have stored your nodemap files either from dic, 
simulation or from a different source, you reach the heart of our fracture analysis. You can detect crack paths and crack tips fully automatically
using our **crack detection** module. This module provides two independent methodologies for crack detection - 
our line intercept method together with an iterative crack tip correction algorithm based on the Williams expansion [**15**] and our trained convolutional neural networks [**4**, **9**]. 
We store the crack tip information in a file (this can also be generated manually) and use it as input for 
the **fracture analysis** pipeline. Here we offer a wide range of methods and algorithms: 
1. Calculate _J-integral_ [**5**, **10**]
2. Calculate stress intensity factors (mode I, mode II) by _interaction integral technique_ [**11**, **12**]
3. Calculate stress intensity factors and Williams series coefficients using _Bueckner's conjugate work integral_ [**6**, **14**]
4. Calculate _higher order singular terms (HOSTs)_ or _higher order regular terms (HORTs)_ of the Williams series [**7**] by fitting the 
   theoretical displacement field to the experimental (or simulated) data.
5. Calculate CJP stress intensity factors which may take effects of plasticity into account by fitting the theoretical displacement field of the _CJP model_ [**8**] the experimental (or simulated) data [**13**]   


Here is an example for the output plot of one single time step...

... and an example how these methods can enable _hybrid approaches of mechanical and data-driven analysis_.

| **_Various possible calculated stress intensity factors for a complete crack growth experiment. Each data point refers to one DIC measurement, i.e. one set of experimental displacements and strains_** |

For us, it was important that all these methods are implemented independent of the source of 
displacement and strain data, i.e. you can also apply all these methods on data from other sources such as finite element simulations, as long as the format of displacements
and strains matches the one used here (Checkout our [Wiki](https://github.com/dlr-wf/crackpy/wiki) 
for detailed information) and fulfills the plane stress condition. We believe that a wider availability of 
automated analysis - and, therefore, more **data-driven methods** -  will be very beneficial for the experimental
mechanics community. This is why we aim to make them easily accessible and applicable. However, this package only covers the topic of 
**(fatigue) cracks in ductile materials**. Although most of our methods are (theoretically) independent of the investigated material, we only tested them on aluminium alloys so far.
