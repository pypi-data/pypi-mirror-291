# ðŸš€ Enhanced Document Semantic Search

## Overview
The "Enhanced Document Semantic Search" package provides powerful tools for searching and analyzing documents using advanced natural language processing techniques. With this package, you can:

- **Search documents**: Quickly find relevant information within your documents by running semantic searches based on natural language queries.
- **Scan and search documents**: Easily extract text from images and PDFs, then perform semantic searches on the extracted content.
- **Utilize cutting-edge embeddings**: The package leverages the state-of-the-art Sentence Transformer model from Hugging Face to generate high-quality document and query embeddings.
- **Achieve high accuracy**: The package uses cosine similarity to rank document relevance, providing accurate and meaningful search results.

## Installation
You can install the "Enhanced Document Search" package using pip:

pip install enhanced-document-search

## Usage
Here's an example of how to use the package to search a document:

```python
from vectrieve.functions import search_document

# Search a document
results = search_document("path/to/document.pdf", "query")
for doc, score in results:
    print(f"Text: {doc.page_content}")
    print(f"Source: {doc.metadata.get('source', 'Unknown')}")
    print(f"Similarity: {score:.4f}")

And here's an example of how to use the package to scan and search a document:

from vectrieve.functions import scan_and_search
from PIL import Image

# Scan and search a document
image = Image.open("path/to/image.jpg")
results = scan_and_search(image, "query")
for doc, score in results:
    print(f"Text: {doc.page_content}")
    print(f"Source: {doc.metadata.get('source', 'Unknown')}")
    print(f"Similarity: {score:.4f}")

Features

Robust document loading: The package supports a variety of file formats, including PDF, DOCX, TXT, XLS, and XLSX.
Intelligent document chunking: The package automatically splits long documents into manageable chunks, ensuring efficient processing and search.
Highly accurate search: The use of cosine similarity and state-of-the-art embeddings provides accurate and relevant search results.
Seamless document scanning: The package can extract text from images using Tesseract OCR, allowing you to search scanned documents.
