Get the copy and type:
~~~~
> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake ../
> make
~~~~

cmake options

compile options, enable or disable with cmake:
> cmake ../ -D[OPTION]

available options:
  * THREADS - enable/disable multi-threading support, default ON
  * PYTHON_MODULE - enable/disable building of the python bindigs, pybind11 library required to build the module, default OFF
  * TESTS - build tests, default OFF
  * EXAMPLES - build examples, default OFF
  * APPS - build nurex applications, ie command line nurex app
  * GSL_INTEGRATION - use adaptive integration from the gsl library instead of built in, default OFF
  * GSL_INTERPOLATION - use spline interpolation from the gsl library, default OFF

ie:
> cmake -DTHREADS=OFF -DPYTHON_NUREX=ON -DEXAMPLES=ON ../


after the compilation the libraries and headers must be either installed system-wide by make install. 
(The default install path can be change, ie: cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/nurex)

Or alternatively the library can be installed in any directory and variables PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH and later include directories must be set accordingly.
This can be done sourcing the init.sh file, which is generated in the build directory:
> source init.sh
