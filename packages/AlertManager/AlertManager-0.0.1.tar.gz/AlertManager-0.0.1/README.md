## Overview

The Job Scheduler is a Python library designed for scheduling and managing recurring tasks (jobs). This library allows you to easily set up jobs that can run at specific intervals (e.g., every minute, every hour, etc.), on specific days, or until a certain time, with support for repetition. Threading is also supported and optional for non-blocking execution.

## Features

- **Flexible Scheduling**: Schedule jobs to run every few seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, or even years.
- **Specific Time Execution**: Run jobs at a specific time of day or on specific days of the week or month.
- **Repeat and Until**: Set jobs to run a certain number of times or until a specific date and time.
- **Threading Support**: Optionally execute jobs in separate threads for non-blocking execution.
- **Two Scheduling Methods**: Jobs can be scheduled using a decorator-based approach or a standard object-oriented method.
- **Simultaneous Job Execution**: Multiple jobs can be scheduled to run at the same time.
- **Easy Job Management**: Add, execute, and manage multiple jobs with a simple API.

## Installation

To install the Job Scheduler, run the following command:

```bash
pip install Timeline-Manager
```

## Usage

### Scheduling Methods

The Job Scheduler provides two main methods for scheduling tasks: the **Standard Method** and the **Decorator Method**. Below are examples of how to use both methods.

### Basic Example (Standard Method)

```python
from AlertManager import JobScheduler, Job

# Initialize the scheduler
scheduler = JobScheduler()


# Define a standard task function
def my_task():
  print("Task executed!")


# Create a job using the standard method
job = Job().every(1).minute.repeat(3).do(my_task)

# Add the job to the scheduler
scheduler.add_job(job)

# Start the scheduler
scheduler.run_pending()
```

### Basic Example (Decorator Method)

```python
from AlertManager import JobScheduler, jobs

# Initialize the scheduler
scheduler = JobScheduler()


# Define a sample job function using the decorator method
@jobs(interval=1, unit='minute', repeat=3, scheduler=scheduler)
def my_task():
  print("Task executed!")


# Start the scheduler
scheduler.run_pending()
```

In both examples:
- The job is scheduled to run every minute.
- It will repeat 3 times before stopping.

### Scheduling Options

The `Job` class provides a variety of options for scheduling jobs. These options can be chained together to create complex scheduling scenarios.

#### Setting Interval and Unit

The `interval` and `unit` methods define how often the job should run. Supported units include:
- `second`
- `minute`
- `hour`
- `day`
- `week`
- `month`
- `year`

```python
job.every(5).minute.do(my_task)
```

This will schedule the job to run every 5 minutes.

### Examples with `every()` for Intervals Greater Than 1

#### Running a Job Every 2 Hours

**Standard Method:**

```python
from AlertManager import JobScheduler, Job

# Initialize the scheduler
scheduler = JobScheduler()


# Define the task function
def task_every_2_hours():
  print("Task executed every 2 hours!")


# Create a job to run every 2 hours
job = Job().every(2).hour.do(task_every_2_hours)

# Add the job to the scheduler
scheduler.add_job(job)

# Start the scheduler
scheduler.run_pending()
```

**Decorator Method:**

```python
from AlertManager import JobScheduler, jobs

# Initialize the scheduler
scheduler = JobScheduler()


@jobs(interval=2, unit='hour', scheduler=scheduler)
def task_every_2_hours():
  print("Task executed every 2 hours!")


# Start the scheduler
scheduler.run_pending()
```

In this example:
- The job is scheduled to run every 2 hours.
- It will continue running indefinitely until the program is stopped or the job is removed.

#### Running a Job Every 3 Days

**Standard Method:**

```python
from AlertManager import JobScheduler, Job

# Initialize the scheduler
scheduler = JobScheduler()


# Define the task function
def task_every_3_days():
  print("Task executed every 3 days!")


# Create a job to run every 3 days
job = Job().every(3).day.do(task_every_3_days)

# Add the job to the scheduler
scheduler.add_job(job)

# Start the scheduler
scheduler.run_pending()
```

**Decorator Method:**

```python
from AlertManager import JobScheduler, jobs

# Initialize the scheduler
scheduler = JobScheduler()


@jobs(interval=3, unit='day', scheduler=scheduler)
def task_every_3_days():
  print("Task executed every 3 days!")


# Start the scheduler
scheduler.run_pending()
```

In this example:
- The job is scheduled to run every 3 days.
- It will continue running every 3 days until the program is stopped or the job is removed.

#### Running a Job Every 2 Weeks on Monday

**Standard Method:**

```python
from AlertManager import JobScheduler, Job

# Initialize the scheduler
scheduler = JobScheduler()


# Define the task function
def task_every_2_weeks():
  print("Task executed every 2 weeks!")


# Create a job to run every 2 weeks on Monday
job = Job().every(2).week(weekday=0).do(task_every_2_weeks)

# Add the job to the scheduler
scheduler.add_job(job)

# Start the scheduler
scheduler.run_pending()
```

**Decorator Method:**

```python
from AlertManager import JobScheduler, jobs

# Initialize the scheduler
scheduler = JobScheduler()


@jobs(interval=2, unit='week', scheduler=scheduler)
def task_every_2_weeks():
  print("Task executed every 2 weeks!")


# Start the scheduler
scheduler.run_pending()
```

In this example:
- The job is scheduled to run every 2 weeks on Monday.
- It will continue running every 2 weeks on the specified weekday until the program is stopped or the job is removed.

#### Running a Job Every 3 Months on the 15th at 9:00 AM

**Standard Method:**

```python
from AlertManager import JobScheduler, Job

# Initialize the scheduler
scheduler = JobScheduler()


# Define the task function
def task_every_3_months():
  print("Task executed every 3 months!")


# Create a job to run every 3 months on the 15th at 9:00 AM
job = Job().every(3).month(day=15, time_at="09:00").do(task_every_3_months)

# Add the job to the scheduler
scheduler.add_job(job)

# Start the scheduler
scheduler.run_pending()
```

**Decorator Method:**

```python
from AlertManager import JobScheduler, jobs

# Initialize the scheduler
scheduler = JobScheduler()


@jobs(interval=3, unit='month', time_at="09:00", scheduler=scheduler)
def task_every_3_months():
  print("Task executed every 3 months!")


# Start the scheduler
scheduler.run_pending()
```

In this example:
- The job is scheduled to run every 3 months on the 15th at 9:00 AM.
- It will continue running every 3 months on the specified date and time until the program is stopped or the job is removed.

#### Running a Job Every 2 Years on January 1st at Midnight

**Standard Method:**

```python
from AlertManager import JobScheduler, Job

# Initialize the scheduler
scheduler = JobScheduler()


# Define the task function
def task_every_2_years():
  print("Task executed every 2 years!")


# Create a job to run every 2 years on January 1st at midnight
job = Job().every(2).year(month=1, day=1, time_at="00:00").do(task_every_2_years)

# Add the job to the scheduler
scheduler.add_job(job)

# Start the scheduler
scheduler.run_pending()
```

**Decorator Method:**

```python
from AlertManager import JobScheduler, jobs

# Initialize the scheduler
scheduler = JobScheduler()


@jobs(interval=2, unit='year', time_at="00:00", scheduler=scheduler)
def task_every_2_years():
  print("Task executed every 2 years!")


# Start the scheduler
scheduler.run_pending()
```

In this example:
- The job is scheduled to run every 2 years on January 1st at midnight.
- It will continue running every 2 years on the specified date and time until the program is stopped or the job is removed.

### Running Multiple Jobs Simultaneously

The Job Scheduler allows you to schedule multiple jobs that can run at the same time. For example, you might want to run two different tasks every day at the same time.

#### Running Multiple Jobs Simultaneously (Standard Method)

```python
from AlertManager import JobScheduler, Job

# Initialize the scheduler
scheduler = JobScheduler()


# Define task functions
def task1():
  print("Task 1 executed!")


def task2():
  print("Task 2 executed!")


# Create jobs that run at the same time
job1 = Job().every(1).day.at("08:00").do(task1)
job2 = Job().every(1).day.at("08:00").do(task2)

# Add jobs to the scheduler
scheduler.add_job(job1)
scheduler.add_job(job2)

# Start the scheduler
scheduler.run_pending()
```

#### Running Multiple Jobs Simultaneously (Decorator Method)

```python
from AlertManager import JobScheduler, jobs

# Initialize the scheduler
scheduler = JobScheduler()


@jobs(interval=1, unit='day', time_at="08:00", scheduler=scheduler)
def task1():
  print("Task 1 executed!")


@jobs(interval=1, unit='day', time_at="08:00", scheduler=scheduler)
def task2():
  print("Task 2 executed!")


# Start the scheduler
scheduler.run_pending()
```

In this example:
- Both `task1` and `task2` are scheduled to run at 8:00 AM every day.
- They will execute simultaneously, allowing multiple tasks to be performed at the same time.

### Weekday, Day, and Month Ranges

When scheduling jobs, you can specify specific weekdays, days of the month, and months. Below are the values for each:

- **Weekday Values**:
  - 0: Monday
  - 1: Tuesday
  - 2: Wednesday
  - 3: Thursday
  - 4: Friday
  - 5: Saturday
  - 6: Sunday

- **Day Values**:
  - 1-31: Represents the days of the month.

- **Month Values**:
  - 1: January
  - 2: February
  - 3: March
  - 4: April
  - 5: May
  - 6: June
  - 7: July
  - 8: August
  - 9: September
  - 10: October
  - 11: November
  - 12: December

### Threading (Optional)

To run jobs in separate threads (useful for non-blocking execution), set `use_threading=True` when initializing the `JobScheduler`.

```python
scheduler = JobScheduler(use_threading=True)
```

In this example:
- The scheduler is set up to run jobs in separate threads, allowing them to execute independently of each other.
- This can be useful for long-running tasks that should not block the execution of other jobs.

### Managing Jobs

The `JobScheduler` class manages the execution of all scheduled jobs. You can add jobs using the `add_job` method and start the scheduler using the `run_pending` method. The scheduler will automatically remove completed jobs.

### Running the Scheduler

To start running the scheduled jobs, call `scheduler.run_pending()` in your main program. This will loop through all jobs and run them if they are scheduled to run.

```python
scheduler.run_pending()
```

### Error Handling

If you pass unsupported units or incorrect time formats, the scheduler will raise appropriate exceptions to help you debug.
