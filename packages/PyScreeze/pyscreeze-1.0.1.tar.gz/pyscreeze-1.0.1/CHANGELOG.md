## [Unreleased] - 2023-10-16

### Added

- Added allScreens argument for Windows only for now.

### Changed

- Set `USE_IMAGE_NOT_FOUND_EXCEPTION` to `True` by default. This is a backwards-compatibility breaking change. Set `USE_IMAGE_NOT_FOUND_EXCEPTION = False` to get the original behavior and have locate functions return None when they can't find an image.
- Renamed CHANGES.txt to CHANGELOG.md and using a changelog template.
- Made screenshot functions more restrictive and force the region arg to a tuple of four ints, instead of converting them to ints.
- Fix for the region argument not working on macOS.
- Fix for PILLOW_VERSION not being correctly translated. #98 #101
- Fix readme example using click() #91
