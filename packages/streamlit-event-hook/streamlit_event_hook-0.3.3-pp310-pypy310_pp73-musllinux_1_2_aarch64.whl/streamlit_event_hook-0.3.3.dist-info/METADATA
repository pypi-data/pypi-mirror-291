# streamlit-event-hook

Hook Streamlit Event

Requirements: streamlit >= 1.37, Python >= 3.8

## Introduction

A Streamlit component that allows you to intercept the start and end of page rendering code written by Streamlit users and listen to events during the rendering process.

Below are the enumerated events:

```
# The script started running.
SCRIPT_STARTED

# The script run stopped because of a compile error.
SCRIPT_STOPPED_WITH_COMPILE_ERROR

# The script run stopped because it ran to completion, or was
# interrupted by the user.
SCRIPT_STOPPED_WITH_SUCCESS

# The script run stopped in order to start a script run with newer widget state.
SCRIPT_STOPPED_FOR_RERUN

# The script run corresponding to a fragment ran to completion, or was interrupted
# by the user.
FRAGMENT_STOPPED_WITH_SUCCESS

# The ScriptRunner is done processing the ScriptEventQueue and
# is shut down.
SHUTDOWN

# "Data" events. These are emitted when the ScriptRunner's script has
# data to send to the frontend.

# The script has a ForwardMsg to send to the frontend.
ENQUEUE_FORWARD_MSG
```


## Installation instructions
