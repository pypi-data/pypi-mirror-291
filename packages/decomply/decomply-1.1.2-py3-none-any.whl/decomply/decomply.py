        Initialize the Decomply object

        Args:
        traverse (callable, optional): A callable function that determines whether
            to traverse further into nested objects during cascading. It takes
            two arguments: `trace` (list) - the current trace of keys, and `item`
            (any) - the current item being evaluated. Defaults to always return True.
        apply (callable, optional): A callable function that applies a transformation
            or operation on an item during cascading when `traverse` condition is not
            met. It takes two arguments: `trace` (list) - the current trace of keys,
            and `item` (any) - the current item being evaluated. Defaults to returning
            the item unchanged.
        delete (callable, optional): A callable function that determines whether to
            delete a key/value pair during cascading based on the key and value. It
            takes two arguments: `trace` (list) - the current trace, and `item` (any) -
            the current item associated with the trace. Defaults to deleting keys that
            start with an underscore (`key.startswith("_")`).
        handlers (Set[EnumerableHandler], optional): A set of @EnumerableHandlers. 
            Such a handler must implement methods to allow handling of an enumerable 
            object. Users may write their own handlers and supply them here, to 
            extend support. In basekit, only list and dict is supported.

            trace (List[Union[str, int, any]], optional): A list representing the current trace of keys
                during traversing. Defaults to None.
            initial_check (bool, optional): Flag indicating whether to perform the initial check
                with the `traverse` condition defined in the constructor (`__init__` method).
                Defaults to True.

            Union[dict, list, any]: An object with the same structure as `item`, modified according to the
                configured `traverse`, `apply`, and `delete` behaviors.

        Notes:
            - The `traverse`, `apply`, and `delete` behaviors are configured during the initialization
            of the Decomply object (`__init__` method).
