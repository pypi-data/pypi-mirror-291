RidePy
======

RidePy is a scientific Python library for simulating modern on-demand transit systems such as ridepooling.

In short: RidePy simulates a dispatching algorithm serving exogenous transportation requests with a fleet of vehicles. Does not simulate the universe, unlike MATSim. Batteries are included.

Head over to `ridepy.org <ridepy doc_>`__ to get started. You might also be interested in our `paper <https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.06241>`__ published in the Journal of Open Source Software.

Quickstart
----------

For detailed instructions, see the `installation guide <https://ridepy.org/howto/install-ridepy>`__ in the documentation.

If you're in a hurry, here's the gist:

- RidePy currently works best with Python 3.9
- If you are on platform other than x86-64 Linux, i.e., one that we don't offer wheels for, you will need to first set up a C++ build environment and the `Boost C++ libraries <https://www.boost.org/>`__. On Debian-like systems, this is easily accomplished with

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt-get install build-essential libboost-all-dev

- Install RidePy with

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install ridepy
