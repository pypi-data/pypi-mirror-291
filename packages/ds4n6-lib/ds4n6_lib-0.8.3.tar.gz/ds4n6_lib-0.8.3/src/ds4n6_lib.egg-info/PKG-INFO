DS4N6 stands for Data Science Forensics.

We also refer to this project as DSDFIR, AI4N6 or AIDFIR, since Data Science (DS) includes Artificial Intelligence (AI), and the project goes beyond the strictly Forensics, covering the whole Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR) discipline (and sometimes even beyond). But hey, we had to give the project a catchy name!

The Mission of the DS4N6 project is simple:

```
Bringing Data Science & Artificial Intelligence
to the fingertips of the average Forensicator,
and promote advances in the field
```

The first (modest) alpha version of our ds4n6 python library, together with some easy-to-use python scripts, was originally made public after the presentation at the SANS DFIR Summit US, July 16-17.

### Prerequisites

The DS4N6 library works on the 3.x versions of the Python programming language. The module has external dependencies related to datascience and extraction of forensic evidence.

Install requirements:

    - python-evtx
    - Evtx
    - ipyaggrid
    - IPython
    - ipywidgets
    - keras
    - matplotlib
    - nbformat
    - numpy
    - pandas
    - pyparsing
    - qgrid
    - ruamel.yaml
    - sklearn
    - tensorflow
    - tqdm
    - traitlets
    - xmltodict
    - networkx
    - gensim

### Installation

The installation can be easily done through pip.

#### pip installation

```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, import in your python3 program or Jupyter Notebook as "ds".

```python
    import ds4n6_lib as ds
```
