A super simple Python utility to check for dead links in a website.

## Installation

PyLich is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pylich/) and can be installed using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):

```bash
pip install pylich
```

## Usage

Simply provide the URL of the sitemap and `pylich` will crawl through links in the pages and check their status. `pylich` can be used as a command line tool or as a Python package.

### Command Line

```bash
pylich https://www.example.com/sitemap.xml -v
```

The `-v` verbosity flag is optional and will print progress to the console as well as a summary of the dead links at the end. The command will exit with a status code of 1 if any dead links are found and 0 otherwise.

### Python Package

```python
from pylich import LinkChecker
checker = LinkChecker("https://www.example.com/sitemap.xml", verbose=True)
urls = checker.get_sitemap_urls()
broken_links = checker.check_links(urls)
checker.print_dead_links()
```
