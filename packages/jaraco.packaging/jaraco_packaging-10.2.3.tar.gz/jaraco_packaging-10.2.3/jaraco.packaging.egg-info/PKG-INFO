Tools for packaging.


sphinx
======

This package provides a Sphinx extension that will inject into the config
the following values from the project's package metadata (as presented by
distutils):

 - project (from name)
 - author
 - copyright (same as author)
 - version
 - release (same as version)
 - package_url (from url)

To enable, include 'jaraco.packaging' in the requirements and add
'jaraco.packaging.sphinx' to the list of extensions in a Sphinx config
file::

    extensions=['jaraco.packaging.sphinx']

The extension by default builds the project in an isolated environment in
order to extract the metadata. For offline builds, set
``BUILD_ENVIRONMENT=current`` and ensure the build dependencies are
met in the current environment.

Deprecated: To build the documentation offline,
provide an already built wheel by setting the environment variable
``JARACO_PACKAGING_SPHINX_WHEEL`` to the path of an existing wheel.


make-tree
=========

A utility for taking output from ``pipdeptree --json`` and producing a tree
rooted at a given package.

Usage::

    pipdeptree --json | python -m jaraco.packaging.make-tree mypkg


metadata
=========

A wrapper around ``build.util.project_wheel_metadata`` to enable dowstream
packagers to indicate that they need an isolated build. Set the environment
variable ``BUILD_ENVIRONMENT=current`` to bypass build isolation and use the
current isolation for loading metadata from a project.
