# FE_workflow
You need to install BioSimSpace first


RFE(Relative Free Energy)
1. RFE_network.py - create a network based on the sdf files of ligands
2. protein cleaning and adding missing residue
3. docking to fine the binding pose (protein binding FE)
4. RFE_parameter.py - add parameter based on force field and provide equilibrium folder
5. RFE_fesetup.py - setup input files for free energy simulation
