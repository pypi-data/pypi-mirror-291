        Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
        does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
        Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
        other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related
        information available on an "as-is" basis. Creative Commons gives no
        warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their
        terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons

        fullest extent possible.
        
        Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
        
        Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
        conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
        original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
        and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
        following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
        exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
        
             Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
             intended for use by those authorized to give the public
             permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
             copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
             irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
             and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
             Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
             applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
             material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
             material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
             licensed material, or material used under an exception or
             limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:

             Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
             licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
             licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
             the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
             example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
             copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
             licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
             other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
             the licensed material may still be restricted for other
             reasons, including because others have copyright or other
             rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
             such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
             Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
             respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations
             for the public:

        interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in
        consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the
        Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the

             permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
             Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
             Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,

             closely related to copyright including, without limitation,

             terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
             all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
             Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

             available to the public including in ways that members of the
             public may access the material from a place and at a time
             individually chosen by them.
        
          m. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
             resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
             the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
             as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
             equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
        
          n. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
             under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
        
        
        Section 2 -- Scope.
        
          a. License grant.
        
               1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
                  the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
                  non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
                  exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
        
                    a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
                       in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and
        
                    b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for
                       NonCommercial purposes only.
        
               2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
                  Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
                  License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
                  its terms and conditions.
        
               3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
                  6(a).
        
               4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
                  Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
                  all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
                  and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
                  Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
                  authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
                  necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
                  technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
                  Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
                  simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
                  (4) never produces Adapted Material.
        
               5. Downstream recipients.
        
                    a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
                       recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
                       receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
                       Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
                       Public License.
        
                    b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.
                       Every recipient of Adapted Material from You
                       automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
                       exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material
                       under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.
        
                    c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
                       any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
                       apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
                       Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
                       Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
                       Material.
        
               6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
                  may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
                  are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
                  with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
                  the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
                  provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
        
          b. Other rights.
        
               1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
                  licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
                  privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
                  the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
                  assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
                  extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
                  Rights, but not otherwise.
        
               2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
                  Public License.
        
               3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
                  collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
                  Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
                  under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
                  licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
                  reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when
                  the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial
                  purposes.
        
        
        Section 3 -- License Conditions.
        
        Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
        following conditions.
        
          a. Attribution.

                  form), You must:
        
                    a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
                       with the Licensed Material:
        
                         i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                            Material and any others designated to receive
                            attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                            the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                            designated);
        
                        ii. a copyright notice;
        
                       iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
        
                        iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                            warranties;
        
                         v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                            extent reasonably practicable;
        
                    b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
                       retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
        
                    c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
                       Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
                       hyperlink to, this Public License.
        
               2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
                  reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
                  which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
                  reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
                  hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
                  information.
               3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
                  information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
                  reasonably practicable.
        
          b. ShareAlike.
        
             In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share
             Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.
        
               1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons
                  license with the same License Elements, this version or
                  later, or a BY-NC-SA Compatible License.
        
               2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the
                  Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition
                  in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and
                  context in which You Share Adapted Material.
        
               3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms
                  or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
                  Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the
                  rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.
        
        
        Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
        
        Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
        apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
        
          a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
             to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
             portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes
             only;
        
          b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
             contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
             Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
             Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,
             including for purposes of Section 3(b); and
        
          c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
             all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
        
        For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
        replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
        Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
        
        
        Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
        
          a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
             EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
             AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
             ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
             IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
             WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
             PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
             ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
             KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
             ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
        
          b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
             TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
             NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
             INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
             COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
             USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
             ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
             DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
             IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
        
          c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
             above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
             possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
             waiver of all liability.
        
        
        Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
        
          a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
             Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with

# Pixoo

A library to easily communicate with the Divoom Pixoo 64 (and hopefully soon more screens that support Wi-Fi)

An non-trivial example, with re-connecting and API-calls can be found in `examples/power-usage`.
In this example I read the current kWh from my P1-meter and display the current power usage of my house in a neat little
graph.

![Simulator buffer simulator](./images/screenshot-2.png)

_Tested on a Pixoo 64, with Python 3.12 on MacOS Sonoma._

## The all new ✨REST-interface✨

It's pretty much fully functional now.
You can find the example in `examples/pixoorest` on how to start a script that runs the REST server.
Most of the methods available in the Pixoo library are supported- except currently for loading a local image (for
obvious
reasons).

Basically, anywhere in the code you can start a (blocking!) server thread by making a `PixooREST` object as such:

```python
PixooREST()
```

Look into the `PixooConfiguration` and `RESTConfiguration` objects if you want to do some customizing. This will be
documented more later on.

These are the currently supported REST calls, and can be made with both POST and GET calls. A more REST-like interface
is coming, but I wanted to make the interface as easily accessible as possible for now.

## The Simulator

.. Simulator might be a bit of a big word, but if you want to test your own drawing stuff,
I've included a simple "simulator" that can render the buffer to a GUI so it's easier to debug without having to connect
to the device.

It's in a very early stage, but it supports all methods that start with `draw_` and can be "pushed" to the GUI, just
the way you'd use it normally.

**NOTE:** When enabling and using the simulator, the actual connection to the device will be completely ignored. So
don't expect to see anything on your device when simulating.

The simulator can be activated as such:

```python
pixoo = Pixoo('192.168.1.137', simulated=True, simulation_config=SimulatorConfig(4))
```

The SimulatorConfig *currently* only takes one argument, which is the `scale` to display the images at. Should be 1 or a
multiple of 2 if you want nice looking results. It seems like 4 and 8 are working great, in my experience. With `scale`
set to 4 it'll look like this on MacOS:

![Simulator buffer simulator](./images/screenshot-1.png)

## Installation

You can install the library as a package via pip

```shell
pip install pixoo
```

Alternatively, you can install the pixoo package as developer locally with next command running from cloned folder:

```shell
python -m pip install -e .
```

Or Simply install the required dependencies via PIP. Navigate to the directory where you installed this library. Then
execute:

```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Install the requirements.txt via pip install

On some newer versions of MacOS, if you want to use the simulator you might have to manually install the `tkinter`
library. I use brew:

```shell
brew install python-tk
```

## Getting started

Create an interface with your device as such (of course use your own local IP-address):

```python
pixoo = Pixoo('192.168.1.137')
```

For now, the easiest way to learn how to use this library is to check the `examples.py`, and the example directory for a
neat project. I'll be adding examples to this page over time as well, once the project matures a bit more.

**NOTE:** Be sure to call `push()` after performing all your draw actions, to push the internal buffer to the screen. *
Try to not call this method more than once per second if you don't want the device to stop responding!*

### Usage

#### Stability increase

Use the `refresh_connection_automatically` boolean variable in the constructor of `Pixoo` to force a reset of the
internal
counter on the device. This should
make the application much more stable at the expensive of a slight delay in updating every 32 frames.
I haven't tested it myself just yet, but theoretically this would solve
the `"After updating the screen +/- 300 times the
display stops responding"` bug.

## Special thanks

### PICO-8's fantastic low-res font

Special thanks goes to the fantastic [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) and its creator. I've written a
small script to convert the font to simple pixel matrixes, which are used as "glyphs" within the `draw_text` methods.

Supported characters so far are:

```
0123456789
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
!'()+,-<=>?[]^_:;./{|}~$@%
```

## Known bugs

### Simulator shows black screen on Macbook with M-processors

Run the following commands (not tested personally, but based on
this [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73056296/tkinter-on-mac-shows-up-as-a-black-screen) thread)

```shell
brew uninstall tcl-tk uninstall
pyenv uninstall 3.10 # Replace this with the global Python version you have installed
brew install tcl-tk
pyenv install 3.10
pyenv global 3.10
```

You need to install tk via homebrew before installing Python with pyenv because pyenv will automatically try to use
whatever tk package it can find when it installs Python.

This will also work if you are using pyenv to upgrade from one version of Python to another.

### Previous buffer/image is still partially visible

Unfortunately, the Divoom Pixoo 64 doesn't seem quite ready for prime time- *yet*. There are some known buffer issues
that can cause issues, basically meaning that parts of the previous image are still displayed even though a newer image
has been pushed to the display. I'm sure this will be fixed in the future though, the dev team seems to be working hard!

### After updating the screen +/- 300 times the display stops responding

This seems to be an internal bug with the current firmware. I'll update the code once a better way to push a buffer to
the screen becomes available.

### TextScrollDirection.RIGHT seems to invert the string

.. and some other issues. Seems like for now, text can only really be scrolling left with most fonts. This will likely (
hopefully?) be fixed by the dev team in the future.
