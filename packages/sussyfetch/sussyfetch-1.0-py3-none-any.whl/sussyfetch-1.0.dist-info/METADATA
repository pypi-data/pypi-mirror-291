# Sussyfetch

ඞ Fetching system information in style.

Sussyfetch is a command-line tool that fetches your system's information with built-in _sussiness_ and shenanigans. It provides a fun and entertaining way to check your system's details, but I claim no responsibility for any mental (or physical) damage caused by using this tool.

## Features

- Get your system's details. Includes OS, CPU, memory, and disk information laced with internet brainrot and _Among Us_ references.
- Each time you run Sussyfetch, you get new outputs with phrases... which ones? Use it to find out.
- Should work on Windows, Linux, macOS, and other operating systems.

## Installation

## Amogus

### FAQ:

- **Why is my system info so sus?**

  - What tool do you think you're using?

- **Can I add my own phrases?**

  - Absolutely! Feel free to customize the script with your own internet memes and references, and submit a pull request.

- **Is this tool serious?**
  - No. Not for serious system diagnostics. Just for fun. (unless...)
