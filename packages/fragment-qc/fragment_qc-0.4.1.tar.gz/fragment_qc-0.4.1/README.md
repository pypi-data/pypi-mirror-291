# Fragmeâˆ©t ðŸ”¨ðŸªž

Fragmeâˆ©t is a fragmentation framework developed by the John Herbert Research group at the Ohio State University. Our goal is to write a package that makes it easy to prototype, implement, and benchmark fragmentation methods. The code is currently in a pre-release state so be aware that features and backwards compatibility are subject to change.

# Install 

Use the following script to get up and running. It assumes you are 
a working Conda installation and that you are subscribed to [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org).

This script will install the `v0.3.0` version of Fragmeâˆ©t into a Conda environment named `fragment`.

```sh
# Create a conda env and install depenencies!
conda create -n fragment "python=3.9" xtb xtb-python 
conda activate fragment

# Instal v0.3.0 of fragment
pip install https://gitlab.com/john-herbert-group/fragment/-/archive/v0.3.0pre/fragment-v0.3.0pre.tar.gz

# Test that fragment is installed 
fragment --help
```

# Getting Started

Suppose we have a cluster comprised of 6 water molecules. This can be run as a fragmentation job using the following steps

## 1. Create a project directory
```sh
mkdir water6
cd water6
fragment project init
```

You should now have a `logs` directory, a `fragment.db` database, and a `file_archive.tar` file.

## 2. Get the `.xyz` formatted file

Save this as `water6.xyz`.

```

## 3. Create a strategy file

fragmention calculations are described using .yaml files. Save the following file as `strategy.yaml`.

```yaml
systems: # Import our systems
  -
    name: w6
    note: water 6 # A note with more information
    source: water6.xyz # Path to the .xyz file we made in step 2

fragmenters:
  - # Describe a fragmenter. The "Water" fragmenter will split a water-only system into
    # indivdual water molecules
    name: waterMBE
    note: Fragmeter for water
    fragmenter: Water

backends:
  - # We will be using xTB as a library
    name: xTB
    note: xTB/GFN2 backend
    program: libxtb

calculations: # Describe our calculation
  -
    name: mbe5
    system: ALL # Run this calculation on all systems (just water 6 in this case)
    note: MBE(5) Calculation
    layers:
      -
        backend: xTB # Run calculations with xTB
        view:
          fragmenter: waterMBE # Use the fragmenter we just defined
          order: 5  # Do an MBE(5 calculation)

```

Now let fragment know about it by running `fragment strategy add strategy.yaml`.

# 4. Run the calculations

If you run `fragment project info` you should see 62 pending jobs. To run these, run `fragment calc run ALL`. You can list all defined calculations using `fragment calc list` and see the details of our calculation using `fragment calc info mbe5__w6`.

You should get a total energy of ~-30.49198 Eh. You can compare this to the supersystem energy from xTB (`xtb water6.xyz`).
