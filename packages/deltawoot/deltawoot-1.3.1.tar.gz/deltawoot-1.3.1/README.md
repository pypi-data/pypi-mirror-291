# deltawoot

A deltachat bot which acts as a chatwoot client,
so users can talk to chatwoot encrypted.


## Installation

You need to connect this bot to a working <https://www.chatwoot.com/> instance,
from now on called `example.org`.
Let's configure chatwoot first:


### Configure a callback URL in chatwoot

The bot needs to be reachable via HTTP from the chatwoot instance,
and you need to enter a callback URL into the chatwoot web interface.
For this, go to `https://example.org/app/accounts/1/settings/integrations`
and configure a new webhook.

For example,
If the bot is running on the same docker host as the chatwoot instance,
enter `http://deltawoot.internal:5000` (deltawoot.internal is the container name),
and enable the `message_created` option.


### Add deltawoot to chatwoot's docker-compose.yml

If you installed chatwoot via docker compose
like [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20230601030620/https://www.chatwoot.com/docs/self-hosted/deployment/docker/),
you can add the deltawoot container
to your chatwoot's docker-compose.yml
like this:

```
services:
  [...]  # here all the chatwoot containers are defined, see https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chatwoot/chatwoot/develop/docker-compose.production.yaml
  deltawoot:
    image: missytake/deltawoot:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    container_name: deltawoot.internal
    env_file: /home/chatwoot/.env
    depends_on:
      - rails
    volumes:
      - deltawoot:/home/deltawoot/files
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:5000:5000"
volumes:
  deltawoot:
```

Then you need to add your environment variables to an `.env` file.
In the example docker-compose.yml above
it is in `/home/chatwoot/.env`,
if you use a different file you should change the path.
It should look like this for example
(more on the meaning of the config parameters below):

```
WOOT_PROFILE_ACCESS_TOKEN=s3cr3t
DELTAWOOT_ADDR=deltawoot@nine.testrun.org
DELTAWOOT_PASSWORD=p4$$w0rD
WOOT_ACCOUNT_ID=1
```

Then you can start the docker container:

```
docker compose up -d
```


### Config Parameters

You can get the `WOOT_PROFILE_ACCESS_TOKEN`
at the bottom of `https://example.org/app/accounts/1/profile/settings`.
Note: after starting chatwoot, you need to give
the account you use to generate the `WOOT_PROFILE_ACCESS_TOKEN`
operator access to the "Deltawoot" API inbox
at `https://example.org/app/accounts/1/settings/inboxes/list`.

For `DELTAWOOT_ADDR`
and `DELTAWOOT_PASSWORD`
you can use any email account.

For the `WOOT_ACCOUNT_ID`,
go to the Chatwoot conversations list
where you want Delta Chat messages to pop up,
e.g. the one which appears directly after logging in.
It should look like `https://example.org/app/accounts/1/dashboard`.
The `WOOT_ACCOUNT_ID` should be the only number in the URL,
in this example `1`, as it is the default.
You might need it if you get a 404 error in the logs
when deltawoot tries to connect to the chatwoot API.


#### Extended Configuration

You can set other environment variables for configuring deltawoot,
for example:

```
WOOT_API_URL=https://example.org/api/v1
DELTAWOOT_NAME=Your friendly Chatwoot Bridge
DELTAWOOT_AVATAR=files/avatar.jpg
DELTAWOOT_HELP_MSG="Hi, ask me for cooking recipes!"
DELTAWOOT_LEAVE_MSG="Please don't add me to groups, write me 1:1 instead."
WOOT_INBOX_ID=1
SENTRY_TOKEN=https://8sahf8dhdufs9fijis9fd@o7898929132132345.ingest.de.sentry.io/3247829357927898
```

`WOOT_API_URL` is only needed
if chatwoot and deltawoot are running on separate hosts;
make sure chatwoot's API URL is reachable from deltawoot's host.
In such a case you also need to reconfigure the callback URL
in chatwoot's Integration settings,
the one we configured in the beginning.

`DELTAWOOT_NAME` will be the bot's display name in Delta Chat.

`DELTAWOOT_AVATAR` will be the bot's avatar in Delta Chat;
if you run deltawoot in docker,
you need to put it into the docker volume,
and prepend the path with `files/`.

`DELTAWOOT_HELP_MSG` is what the bot will say
if you scan it's invite code or
if you send `/help` to it.
You can customize it in your language.

If you try to add the bot to a group,
the bot will leave the group at once,
but send the person who added it an explanation.
`DELTAWOOT_LEAVE_MSG` is what the bot says
in such a situation.

By default, deltawoot creates an API channel itself.
But if you want to use an existing API channel,
you can manually set the `WOOT_INBOX_ID`.
Go to the settings of the API channel you want to use
at `example.org/app/accounts/1/settings/inboxes/list`,
click on the Settings,
look at the number at the end of the URL,
and add it as `WOOT_INBOX_ID`.

If you want to monitor deltawoot errors with <https://sentry.io>,
you can specify a `SENTRY_TOKEN` as environment variable.


### Add Agents to the Delta Chat Inbox

Now you have to add some agents to your Inbox,
so they can actually read the messages
incoming via Delta Chat.

For this, go to `https://example.org/app/accounts/1/settings/inboxes/list`
and next to "Delta Chat",
click on the settings wheel.
Then click on "Collaborators",
add all agents you want to handle the incoming requests,
and finally click on "Update".


### Publish the Invite Link for Your Bot

Now you can look into the logs
with `docker logs -ft deltawoot.internal`,
to find out the join code of the bot:

```

```

Copy-paste the `OPENPGP4FPR:` and everything behind it
into the form at <https://i.delta.chat>
to generate an invite link which you can advertise on your contact page.

## Development

If you want to develop without docker,
you can configure and start deltawoot like this:

```
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .[dev]
export WOOT_URL=https://example.org/api/v1
export WOOT_PROFILE_ACCESS_TOKEN=s3cr3t
export WOOT_ACCOUNT_ID=1
export DELTAWOOT_ADDR=deltawoot@nine.testrun.org
export DELTAWOOT_PASSWORD=p4$$w0rD
deltawoot
```

You can run the tests with `pytest`.
