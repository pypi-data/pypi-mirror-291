# runapy

This project provides a Python client to interact with the [Run:ai REST API](https://app.run.ai/api/docs).

 The client offers:
- A single class interface to perform all API actions
- Body scheme validation on compilation (with Pydantic)
- Static type checks
- Retry mechanism for resiliency on intermittent network errors
- Debug messages flag

## Requirements:
 - Run:ai control-plane version of 2.18 and above
 - Python version of 3.11 or above
 - [Run:ai Client Application](https://docs.run.ai/v2.13/developer/rest-auth/#create-a-client-application)

 #### Note on token and permissions
When creating an application, it is important to select the relevant role and scope for the required API actions.\
Some API calls may fail with 403 if the application token has no sufficient permissions.

## Installation

runapy is avaialble in PyPi and can be downloaded directly as a python package
```bash
pip3 install runapy
```

## Client

RunaiClient is the only class required to interact with the [Run:ai REST API](https://app.run.ai/api/docs)

```python
from runai.client import RunaiClient

client = RunaiClient(
            realm="myorgrealm",
            client_id="API"
            client_secret="clientsecret",
            runai_base_url="https://myorg.run.ai",
            cluster_id="513423qx-127t-4yk6-979g-5po843g37e2b",
            retries=3,
            debug=False
    )
```
| Parameter | Type     | Description                       |
| :-------- | :------- | :-------------------------------- |
| `realm`      | `string` | **Required**: Can be obtained from the UI login screen at your Run:ai domain app.run.ai -> app.run.ai/auth/realms/<realm>|
| `client_id`      | `string` | **Required**: The Run:ai application name |
| `client_secret`      | `string` | **Required**: The Run:ai application password |
| `runai_base_url`      | `string` | **Required**: The URL used to access Run:ai UI|
| `retries`      | `int` | **Required**: Number of retries to attempt on each failed API call for 5xx errors |
| `debug`      | `bool` | **Optional**: Debug mode output |

## Note on Controllers
The RuaniClient exposes object controllers for all API endpoints.
For example, to access projects:
```python
from runai.client import RunaiClient

client = RunaiClient(
            realm="myorgrealm",
            client_id="API",
            client_secret="clientsecret",
            runai_base_url="https://myorg.run.ai",
            cluster_id="513423qx-127t-4yk6-979g-5po843g37e2b",
            retries=3,
            debug=False
    )

client.projects.all()
```
`client.projects.all()` returns a list of all projects in a given cluster according to the cluster id of the RunaiClient.

Currently supported controllers:
```python
client.projects
client.node_pools
client.departments
client.access_rules
client.roles
client.users

client.workloads
client.workspace
client.training
client.inference
client.distributed
```
Each controller exposes the function `options()` so you can see which methods are currently availalble for a given controller.\
For example:
```python
client.roles.options()
-> 
['all', 'get', 'get_roles_name_to_id_map']
```

Controller methods are documented.\
Hover on the method parentheses to see the required and optional fields to pass to the function
