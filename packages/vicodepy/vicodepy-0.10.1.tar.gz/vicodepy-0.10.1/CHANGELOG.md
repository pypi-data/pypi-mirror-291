CHANGELOG
=========

0.10.1 - 2024-08-22
-------------------

This is a maintenance release. The changes visible to the user are:

- Use a neutral (gray) color for the occurrence being created.
- When clicking or double-clicking on an occurrence, the associated timeline is also selected.
- When selecting a timeline, ensure that all other timelines are deselected.

Several changes are made in the code, improving its maintainability and its readability. An important change is the concept of "Annotation” that is transformed into “Occurrence” (in the sense of “occurrence of an event”). This is part of the ongoing change of the nomenclature in the code.

0.10.0 - 2024-08-17
-------------------

This version contains version 3 of the FORMAT file. The main changes in the format are:

- The format of the `timeline` field in the configuration has been completely changed. Both collections of timelines and events are now associative arrays, instead of lists. 
- The `duration` column has been dropped from the data file.
- The column `label` is renamed to `event`, in the data file.
- The ordering of the timelines in the time pane is determined by the `order` field and the key names.

This version also introduces an important change in the way events are treated in the code. The representation of timelines and events is now more robust than in the previous releases. In particular, it is impossible now to have two events of two timelines with the same name.

The dialogues for editing events and timelines are improved. It is now possible to edit the descriptions of events and timelines. Tool tips are added to provide an instant information on events and timelines.

The data file (in CSV format) is now manipulated using the Pandas module. This adds a new dependency to ViCodePy.

0.9.1 - 2024-08-15
------------------

This is a maintenance release.

Enhancements in the user interface:

- Several dialogues are now centered on main window (Coders, Timeline label, Comment Annotation, and File format warning). This also ensures that the components of the dialog window will follow the QSS style specifications.
- Changes in menu entries:
    - “Add Timeline line” ⇒ “Add Timeline”
    - “Export CSV” ⇒ “Export Data”
- Add icon for “Toggle Fullscreen” menu action.
- Add icons to modal dialog buttons (in method Timeline.edit_label).
- The styles of QLineEdit and QTextEdit widgets are improved.

Bug fixes:

- The variables `project_file_path` and `coders` are moved from the class `MainWindow` into the class `Files`. This was preventing the proper saving of the project file.
- The access to the data file and the metadata file was mangled. This is fixed in the present release.

Several code improvements, invisible to the user, have been made. Most notably, we are now using pandas, instead of the standard csv module, for loading/saving the data file.

0.9.0 - 2024-08-06
------------------

The user interface is improved in this release. In the three situation where the user can choose/change events names and colors (i.e., [1] when creating a new annotation, [2] when changing the event associated with an existing annotation, and [3] when editing the events on a timeline), the same dialog is used (the class ChangeEvent). This closes issue #103.

Furthermore:

Bug fix: The events dialog is always centered on the main application window.

Enhancement: One of the timelines is always selected at start time.

0.8.2 - 2024-08-05
------------------

This is a maintenance release. Some improvements have been made to the user interface:

- Events are now sorted using the lower-case version of their names.
- In the change event dialog window, add text "Name:" before the field for the label and the “Cancel” button is renamed to “Finish”. Furthermore, the “New” button is now show in the bottom row and the buttons can be selected by using the arrow keys (the default one is show with thicker borders).
- The change event dialog is now centered on the main window.
- The jagging of the video slide, when the video time is updated, is fixed.

Several minor bug fixes and code improvements are also done in this release.

0.8.1 - 2024-08-03
------------------

Enhancements:

- When the mouse hover over an annotation, the comment associated with it is shown in the tooltip. When the annotation has no comment, the tooltip shows `(no comment)`.
- The term `CSV` has been change to `data`, were it is appropriate.
- The cursor handle is made taller (the whole height of the `TimePaneScale` widget) and is now transparent.

Bug fixes:

Most of these bugs were caused by the code reorganization in the previous release. They were causing wrong behavior of the application.

- Add the lacking icon file with the plus (+) sign
- Fix name of method `Annotation.calculateBounds` to `.get_bounds`
- Ensure that first argument of `QMessageBox` is a widget
- Give sensible widget as argument of `QFileDialog.getSaveFileName`
- Use method `TimePane.has_annotations`
- Ensure that the variable `temp_dir` of class `Files` is initialized
- Correctly disable the menu item
- Fix call to `ConfirmMessageBox`
- Really cleanup the temporary directory at exit

Several improvements have been made to the code, mainly related to coherence and style. These changes are not visible to the user.

0.8.0 - 2024-08-02
------------------

It is now possible to specify the size of the window from the command line, by using either the `--size` option or the `--fullscreen` option.

The code has been completely reorganized and rationalized. The code in files video.py and widgets.py is now scattered into logical chunks into separated files.

0.7.4 - 2024-07-21
------------------

This is a maintenance release. The terminology in the code has been improved. User visible changes:

- The application menu has been reorganized. There are now submenus for manipulating timelines and annotations. There are now entries for accessing the GitLab repository and the project page at PyPI.

- The About window has been improved. It contains now information about the copyright notices and the license terms, as well as the upstream links.

0.7.3 - 2024-07-20
------------------

This is a maintenance release. User visible changes:

- The Escape key now aborts the creation of an annotation.

- The selected annotation can now be deleted by using the Backspace or the Delete keys.

- The selected timeline can be changed by using the Up and Down keys.

0.7.2 - 2024-07-18
------------------

This is a maintenance release.

Enhancements in the interface:

- When an annotation has just been created, it will appear with thick borders, indicating that it is under the cursor.

- The Enter key can now be used as a shortcut to select the annotation under the cursor. Furthermore, when an annotation is selected, pressing the Enter key will deselect it.

- The active annotation handle appears now with thick borders.

Bug fix:

- In the previous version, when moving an annotation handle by keeping the Right key pressed, it could go past the beginning borer of the subsequent annotation in the timeline. This has been fixed.

0.7.1 - 2024-07-17
------------------

This is a maintenance release. The distributed config.yml file has been changed. The event "ag" (attention getter) has been added and the colors of the events in the "gaze" timeline have been changed.

0.7.0 - 2024-07-16
------------------

New features:

- The format of the project file is upgraded to 2. This introduces a backward-incompatibility which may affect users. Indeed, previous versions of ViCodePy will refuse to load a project file with version 1 and the user will be invited to upgrade the application.

- The identity of the person doing the code (name and email address), as well as the date and time of last modification are now stored into the configuration file (in the `coders` field). The identity information is asked when the project file is saved for the first time and is persistent for the duration of the session.

- A new context menu is now added when right-clicking on a timeline. It allows to:
  * Add a new timeline.
  * Delete the timeline. This is not yet fully operational, since the timeline is not actually removed. For now, the timeline is only emptied from its annotations.
  * Edit the timeline label.
  * Edit the events defined for the timeline. it is possible to change the label and the background color of each event already defined for the current timeline.

Bug fix:

The base name of the CSV file saved in the project file is now exactly the same as the base name of the video file. In the previous version, it was wrongly set to the name of the ZIP file.

0.6.4 - 2024-07-13
------------------

This is a maintenance release, which fixes the reading of the CSV file.

0.6.3 - 2024-07-12
------------------

This is a maintenance release, with some code improvements. The only user visible change is the fixing of a bug causing the label of the annotation not changed when the event was changed.

0.6.2 - 2024-07-11
------------------

This is a bug-fixing, maintenance release. User visible changes:

- The format version of the project file is set to 1. In the previous release, it was wrongly set to 2.
- The Help/About window shows now the format version of the project file.

0.6.1 - 2024-07-11
------------------

This is a bug-fixing, maintenance release. User visible changes:

- When moving the borders of the selected annotation, they cannot go past the borders of adjacent annotations.
- Better logic for finding the current version of ViCodePy.

0.6.0 - 2024-07-08
------------------

New features:

- All the work done during a session can now be saved in a “project file”. This file is in ZIP format and contains the video file, the configuration file (which defines the timelines and the style of the events), and the CSV file (which contains the annotations). This file can also be loaded into ViCodePy, in order to resume of visualize previous sessions. The format of the project file is described in the `FORMAT.md` file. Provisions will be made for assuring backward and forward compatibility regarding the format of the project file.

- It is now possible to do further manipulations on a annotation, once it is created, by right-clicking on it:
  - Change the label (and the associated color) of the annotation.
  - Add comments to the annotation.
  - Merge with an adjacent annotation, if there is no gap between both of them and if they both indicate the same event.

- The configuration system is improved:
  - The loading of the configuration file `config.yml` is now incremental. Files named `config.yml` are read from the package, the system, the user, and the local directories, in this order. Latter settings override the former.
  - It is now possible to specify the separator for the CSV files (typically `,` or `;`), in the `config.yml` file.

- In the CSV file, time is now coded in milliseconds, instead of seconds. This avoids errors related to floating point precision.

- There is now an “About” entry in the “Help” for showing the version of ViCodePy.

- It is possible to horizontally scroll the timelines with Shift + mouse wheel.

- The annotation under the cursor is now highlighted. This is useful for creating contiguous annotations.

- Clicking on a timeline selects it. Double-clicking selects the timeline and move the cursor to the mouse pointer position.

Bugs fixed:

- Fixed several visualization problems, related to the zooming of the timeline and the location of annotation borders and the cursor, which are now precisely placed at the instant of time corresponding the each image in the video.

- The responses to the key presses are improved. In particular, if the Right key is kept pressed, the movie is played continuously.

- Several minor bugs in the interface have been fixed.

0.5.2 - 2024-06-21
------------------

Maintenance release: Integrate the changes for indicating the active timeline via the title bar (forgotten in last version).

0.5.1 - 2024-06-21
------------------

Enhancements:

- The handle for the video player / timeline editor splitter changes now its color when hovered by the mouse
- The title bars of the timelines change color to indicate which one is selected

User-invisible change:

- Code files reorganization

0.5.0 - 2024-06-20
------------------

New features:

- When clicking on the timeline, the cursor is moved to the mouse position
- It is possible to go forward and backward in time in steps of 5 and 10 frames, either with keystrokes or with buttons in the video player
- Durations of the annotations are now saved in the CSV file
- New system for loading the configuration files (local-, user- and system-wide)
- The program does not exit before proposing to save the created annotations

User-visible fixed bugs:

- During the creation of a new annotation, the other existing annotation can not be made active
- The choice of color for a new label is persistent
- The menu entry for the creation of an annotation is more informative
- The existence of the video file is checked before loading it
