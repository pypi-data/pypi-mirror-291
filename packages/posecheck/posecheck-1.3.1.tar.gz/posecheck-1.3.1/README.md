## What is PoseCheck?

PoseCheck is a package for analysing the quality of generated protein-ligand complexes from 3D target-conditioned generative models.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cch1999/posecheck.git
cd posecheck

pip install -e .
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Example usage

We provide a simple top level API to easily interact with the whole of the benchmark. Just define the `PoseCheck` object once at the top of your existing testing code and test molecules by loading them in iteratively. You can also use all the testing functions manually as well (see Docs for more info).

```python
from posecheck import PoseCheck

# Initialize the PoseCheck object
pc = PoseCheck()

# Load a protein from a PDB file (will run reduce in the background)
pc.load_protein_from_pdb("data/examples/1a2g.pdb")

# Load ligands from an SDF file
pc.load_ligands_from_sdf("data/examples/1a2g_ligand.sdf")
# Alternatively, load RDKit molecules directly
# pc.load_ligands_from_mols([rdmol])

# Check for clashes
clashes = pc.calculate_clashes()
print(f"Number of clashes in example molecule: {clashes[0]}")

# Check for strain
strain = pc.calculate_strain_energy()
print(f"Strain energy of example molecule: {strain[0]}")

# Check for interactions
interactions = pc.calculate_interactions()
print(f"Interactions of example molecule: {interactions}")
```

## Tips

- We use [reduce](https://github.com/rlabduke/reduce) for adding hydrogens to proteins. The default executable path is `reduce` but you can change this using `PoseCheck(reduce_path = "/path/to/reduce")`

- Reading and processing all the PDB files using `reduce` can take a while for a large test set. If you are running `PoseCheck` frequently, it might be worth pre-processing all proteins yourself using `prot = posecheck.utils.loading.load_protein_from_pdb(pdb_path)` and setting this directly within `PoseCheck` using `pc.protein = prot`.
