To just install this as quickly as possible, using a Debian or Ubuntu
system, run the following as root:

   apt-get install python-setuptools python-twisted python-ipaddress graphviz

   python setup.py install

It's recommended to use a virtualenv (see below), but on OSX (and
assuming homebrew is installed):

   brew install geoip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r dev-requirements.txt

Or, instead of installing locally, simply:

   export PYTHONPATH=.


If you want to take slightly more time, but only install temporarily,
use virtualenv:

   apt-get install python-setuptools python-pip
   mkdir tmp
   virtualenv tmp/txtorcon_env
   cd tmp/txtorcon_env
   source bin/activate
   pip install --editable .  # this will download from internets:

(Or you can type "make virtualenv" which creates tmp/txtorcon_env, up
to the "activate" step above)

Now, this should work (where "work" means "prints nothing"):

   python -c "import txtorcon"
