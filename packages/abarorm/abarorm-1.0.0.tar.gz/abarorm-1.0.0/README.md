## Features

- Define models using Python classes
- Automatically handle database schema creation and management
- Support for basic CRUD operations

- **New in v1.0.0**: Automatic table creation and updates without needing explicit `create_table()` calls

## Installation

You can install **abarorm** from PyPI using pip:

```bash
pip install abarorm
```
For MySQL support, you also need to install `mysql-connector-python`:
```python
pip install mysql-connector-python
```

## Basic Usage
Hereâ€™s a quick overview of how to use **abarorm** to define models and interact with an SQLite or MySQL database.

## Documentation
For detailed documentation, examples, and advanced usage, please visit the [official abarorm documentation website](https://prodbygodfather.github.io/abarorm/).

## Version 1.0.0 Notes
**Automatic Table Management:** Tables are now automatically created or updated based on model definitions without manual intervention.
**Important for Developers:** During development, when adding new fields to models, they will default to `NULL`. It's recommended to recreate the database schema after development is complete to ensure fields have appropriate constraints and default values.
