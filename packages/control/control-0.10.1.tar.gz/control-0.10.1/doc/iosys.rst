Input/output systems
********************

Module usage
============

An input/output system is defined as a dynamical system that has a system
state as well as inputs and outputs (either inputs or states can be empty).
The dynamics of the system can be in continuous or discrete time.  To simulate
an input/output system, use the :func:`~control.input_output_response`
function::

  resp = ct.input_output_response(io_sys, T, U, X0, params)
  t, y, x = resp.time, resp.outputs, resp.states

An input/output system can be linearized around an equilibrium point to obtain
a :class:`~control.StateSpace` linear system.  Use the
:func:`~control.find_eqpt` function to obtain an equilibrium point and the
:func:`~control.linearize` function to linearize about that equilibrium point::

  xeq, ueq = ct.find_eqpt(io_sys, X0, U0)
  ss_sys = ct.linearize(io_sys, xeq, ueq)

Input/output systems are automatically created for state space LTI systems
when using the :func:`~control.ss` function.  Nonlinear input/output
systems can be created using the :func:`~control.nlsys` function, which
requires the definition of an update function (for the right hand side of
the differential or different equation) and an output function (computes
the outputs from the state)::

  io_sys = ct.nlsys(updfcn, outfcn, inputs=M, outputs=P, states=N)

More complex input/output systems can be constructed by using the
:func:`~control.interconnect` function, which allows a collection of
input/output subsystems to be combined with internal connections
between the subsystems and a set of overall system inputs and outputs
that link to the subsystems::

    steering = ct.interconnect(
        [plant, controller], name='system',
        connections=[['controller.e', '-plant.y']],
        inplist=['controller.e'], inputs='r',
        outlist=['plant.y'], outputs='y')

Interconnected systems can also be created using block diagram manipulations
such as the :func:`~control.series`, :func:`~control.parallel`, and
:func:`~control.feedback` functions.  The :class:`~control.InputOutputSystem`
class also supports various algebraic operations such as `*` (series
interconnection) and `+` (parallel interconnection).

Example
=======

To illustrate the use of the input/output systems module, we create a
model for a predator/prey system, following the notation and parameter
values in FBS2e.

We begin by defining the dynamics of the system

.. code-block:: python

  import control as ct
  import numpy as np
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

  def predprey_rhs(t, x, u, params):
      # Parameter setup
      a = params.get('a', 3.2)
      b = params.get('b', 0.6)
      c = params.get('c', 50.)
      d = params.get('d', 0.56)
      k = params.get('k', 125)
      r = params.get('r', 1.6)

      # Map the states into local variable names
      H = x[0]
      L = x[1]

      # Compute the control action (only allow addition of food)
      u_0 = u[0] if u[0] > 0 else 0

      # Compute the discrete updates
      dH = (r + u_0) * H * (1 - H/k) - (a * H * L)/(c + H)
      dL = b * (a * H *  L)/(c + H) - d * L

      return np.array([dH, dL])

We now create an input/output system using these dynamics:

.. code-block:: python

  io_predprey = ct.nlsys(
      predprey_rhs, None, inputs=('u'), outputs=('H', 'L'),
      states=('H', 'L'), name='predprey')

Note that since we have not specified an output function, the entire state
will be used as the output of the system.

The `io_predprey` system can now be simulated to obtain the open loop dynamics
of the system:

.. code-block:: python

  X0 = [25, 20]                 # Initial H, L
  T = np.linspace(0, 70, 500)   # Simulation 70 years of time

  # Simulate the system
  t, y = ct.input_output_response(io_predprey, T, 0, X0)

  # Plot the response
  plt.figure(1)
  plt.plot(t, y[0])
  plt.plot(t, y[1])
  plt.legend(['Hare', 'Lynx'])
  plt.show(block=False)

We can also create a feedback controller to stabilize a desired population of
the system.  We begin by finding the (unstable) equilibrium point for the
system and computing the linearization about that point.

.. code-block:: python

  eqpt = ct.find_eqpt(io_predprey, X0, 0)
  xeq = eqpt[0]                         # choose the nonzero equilibrium point
  lin_predprey = ct.linearize(io_predprey, xeq, 0)

We next compute a controller that stabilizes the equilibrium point using
eigenvalue placement and computing the feedforward gain using the number of
lynxes as the desired output (following FBS2e, Example 7.5):

.. code-block:: python

  K = ct.place(lin_predprey.A, lin_predprey.B, [-0.1, -0.2])
  A, B = lin_predprey.A, lin_predprey.B
  C = np.array([[0, 1]])                # regulated output = number of lynxes
  kf = -1/(C @ np.linalg.inv(A - B @ K) @ B)

To construct the control law, we build a simple input/output system that
applies a corrective input based on deviations from the equilibrium point.
This system has no dynamics, since it is a static (affine) map, and can
constructed using :func:`~control.nlsys` with no update function:

.. code-block:: python

  io_controller = ct.nlsys(
    None,
    lambda t, x, u, params: -K @ (u[1:] - xeq) + kf * (u[0] - xeq[1]),
    inputs=('Ld', 'u1', 'u2'), outputs=1, name='control')

The input to the controller is `u`, consisting of the vector of hare and lynx
populations followed by the desired lynx population.

To connect the controller to the predatory-prey model, we use the
:func:`~control.interconnect` function:

.. code-block:: python

  io_closed = ct.interconnect(
    [io_predprey, io_controller],	# systems
    connections=[
      ['predprey.u', 'control.y[0]'],
      ['control.u1',  'predprey.H'],
      ['control.u2',  'predprey.L']
    ],
    inplist=['control.Ld'],
    outlist=['predprey.H', 'predprey.L', 'control.y[0]']
  )

Finally, we simulate the closed loop system:

.. code-block:: python

  # Simulate the system
  t, y = ct.input_output_response(io_closed, T, 30, [15, 20])

  # Plot the response
  plt.figure(2)
  plt.subplot(2, 1, 1)
  plt.plot(t, y[0])
  plt.plot(t, y[1])
  plt.legend(['Hare', 'Lynx'])
  plt.subplot(2, 1, 2)
  plt.plot(t, y[2])
  plt.legend(['input'])
  plt.show(block=False)

Additional features
===================

The I/O systems module has a number of other features that can be used to
simplify the creation and use of interconnected input/output systems.

Vector elements processing
--------------------------

Several I/O system commands perform processing of vector elements
(such as initial states or input vectors) and broadcast these to the
proper shape.

For static elements, such as the initial state in a simulation or the
nominal state and input for a linearization), the following processing
is done:

* Scalars are automatically converted to a vector of the appropriate
  size consisting of the scalar value. This is commonly used when
  specifying the origin ('0') or a step input ('1').

* Lists of values are concatenated into a single vector.  This is
  often used when you have an interconnected system and you need to
  specify the initial condition or input value for each subsystem
  (e.g., [X1eq, X2eq, ...]).

* Vector elements are zero padded to the required length. If you
  specify only a portion of the values for states or inputs, the
  remaining values are taken as zero.  (If the final element in the
  given vector is non-zero, a warning is issued.)

Similar processing is done for input time series, used for the
:func:`~control.input_output_response` and
:func:`~control.forced_response` commands, with the following
additional feature:

* Time series elements are broadcast to match the number of time points
  specified.  If a list of time series and static elements are given (as a
  list), static elements are broadcast to the proper number of time points,
  and the overall list of elements concatenated to provide the full input
  vector.

As an example, suppose we have an interconnected system consisting of three
subsystems, a controlled process, an estimator, and a (static) controller::

  proc = ct.nlsys(...,
      states=2, inputs=['u1', 'u2', 'd'], outputs='y')
  estim = ct.nlsys(...,
      states=2, inputs='y', outputs=['xhat[0]', 'xhat[1]')
  ctrl = ct.nlsys(...,
      states=0, inputs=['r', 'xhat[0]', 'xhat[1]'], outputs=['u1', 'u2'])

  clsys = ct.interconnect(
      [proc, estim, ctrl], inputs=['r', 'd'], outputs=['y', 'u1', 'u2'])

To linearize the system around the origin, we can utilize the scalar
processing feature of vector elements::

  P = proc.linearize(0, 0)

In this command, the states and the inputs are broadcast to the size of the
state and input vectors, respectively.

If we want to linearize the closed loop system around a process state
``x0`` (with two elements) and an estimator state ``0`` (for both states),
we can use the list processing feature::

  H = clsys.linearize([x0, 0], 0)

Note that this also utilizes the zero-padding functionality, since the
second argument in the list ``[x0, 0]`` is a scalar and so the vector
``[x0, 0]`` only has three elements instead of the required four.

To run an input/output simulation with a sinusoidal signal for the first
input, a constant for the second input, and no external disturbance, we can
use the list processing feature combined with time series broadcasting::

  timepts = np.linspace(0, 10)
  u1 = np.sin(timepts)
  u2 = 1
  resp = ct.input_output_response(clsys, timepts, [u1, u2, 0])

In this command, the second and third arguments will be broadcast to match
the number of time points.

Summing junction
----------------

The :func:`~control.summing_junction` function can be used to create an
input/output system that takes the sum of an arbitrary number of inputs.  For
example, to create an input/output system that takes the sum of three inputs,
use the command

.. code-block:: python

  sumblk = ct.summing_junction(3)

By default, the name of the inputs will be of the form ``u[i]`` and the output
will be ``y``.  This can be changed by giving an explicit list of names::

  sumblk = ct.summing_junction(inputs=['a', 'b', 'c'], output='d')

A more typical usage would be to define an input/output system that compares a
reference signal to the output of the process and computes the error::

  sumblk = ct.summing_junction(inputs=['r', '-y'], output='e')

Note the use of the minus sign as a means of setting the sign of the input 'y'
to be negative instead of positive.

It is also possible to define "vector" summing blocks that take
multi-dimensional inputs and produce a multi-dimensional output.  For example,
the command

.. code-block:: python

  sumblk = ct.summing_junction(inputs=['r', '-y'], output='e', dimension=2)

will produce an input/output block that implements ``e[0] = r[0] - y[0]`` and
``e[1] = r[1] - y[1]``.

Automatic connections using signal names
----------------------------------------

The :func:`~control.interconnect` function allows the interconnection of
multiple systems by using signal names of the form ``sys.signal``.  In many
situations, it can be cumbersome to explicitly connect all of the appropriate
inputs and outputs.  As an alternative, if the ``connections`` keyword is
omitted, the :func:`~control.interconnect` function will connect all signals
of the same name to each other.  This can allow for simplified methods of
interconnecting systems, especially when combined with the
:func:`~control.summing_junction` function.  For example, the following code
will create a unity gain, negative feedback system::

  P = ct.tf([1], [1, 0], inputs='u', outputs='y')
  C = ct.tf([10], [1, 1], inputs='e', outputs='u')
  sumblk = ct.summing_junction(inputs=['r', '-y'], output='e')
  T = ct.interconnect([P, C, sumblk], inplist='r', outlist='y')

If a signal name appears in multiple outputs then that signal will be summed
when it is interconnected.  Similarly, if a signal name appears in multiple
inputs then all systems using that signal name will receive the same input.
The :func:`~control.interconnect` function will generate an error if a signal
listed in ``inplist`` or ``outlist`` (corresponding to the inputs and outputs
of the interconnected system) is not found, but inputs and outputs of
individual systems that are not connected to other systems are left
unconnected (so be careful!).

Advanced specification of signal names
--------------------------------------

In addition to manual specification of signal names and automatic
connection of signals with the same name, the
:func:`~control.interconnect` has a variety of other mechanisms
available for specifying signal names.  The following forms are
recognized for the `connections`, `inplist`, and `outlist`
parameters::

  (subsys, index, gain)             tuple form with integer indices
  ('sysname', 'signal', gain)	    tuple form with name lookup
  'sysname.signal[i]'		    string form (gain = 1)
  '-sysname.signal[i]'		    set gain to -1
  (subsys, [i1, ..., iN], gain)     signals with indices i1, ..., in
  'sysname.signal[i:j]'             range of signal names, i through j-1
  'sysname'			    all input or outputs of system
  'signal'			    all matching signals (in any subsystem)

For tuple forms, mixed specifications using integer indices and
strings are possible.

For the index range form `sysname.signal[i:j]`, if either `i` or `j`
is not specified, then it defaults to the minimum or maximum value of
the signal range.  Note that despite the similarity to slice notation,
negative indices and step specifications are not supported.

Using   these  various   forms  can   simplfy  the   specification  of
interconnections.  For example, consider a process with inputs 'u' and
'v',  each of  dimension  2, and  two  outputs 'w'  and  'y', each  of
dimension 2::

  P = ct.rss(
        states=6, name='P', strictly_proper=True,
        inputs=['u[0]', 'u[1]', 'v[0]', 'v[1]'],
        outputs=['y[0]', 'y[1]', 'z[0]', 'z[1]'])

Suppose we construct a controller with 2 inputs and 2 outputs that
takes the (2-dimensional) error `e` and outputs and control signal `u`::

  C = ct.rss(4, 2, 2, name='C', input_prefix='e', output_prefix='u')

Finally, we include a summing block that will take the difference between
the reference input `r` and the measured output `y`::

  sumblk = ct.summing_junction(
    inputs=['r', '-y'], outputs='e', dimension=2, name='sum')

The closed loop system should close the loop around the process
outputs `y` and inputs `u`, leaving the process inputs `v` and outputs
'w', as well as the reference input `r`.  We would like the output of
the closed loop system to consist of all system outputs `y` and `z`,
as well as the controller input `u`.

This collection of systems can be combined in a variety of ways.  The
most explict would specify every signal::

  clsys1 = ct.interconnect(
    [C, P, sumblk],
    connections=[
      ['P.u[0]', 'C.u[0]'], ['P.u[1]', 'C.u[1]'],
      ['C.e[0]', 'sum.e[0]'], ['C.e[1]', 'sum.e[1]'],
      ['sum.y[0]', 'P.y[0]'], ['sum.y[1]', 'P.y[1]'],
    ],
    inplist=['sum.r[0]', 'sum.r[1]', 'P.v[0]', 'P.v[1]'],
    outlist=['P.y[0]', 'P.y[1]', 'P.z[0]', 'P.z[1]', 'C.u[0]', 'C.u[1]']
  )

This connections can be simplified using signal ranges::

  clsys2 = ct.interconnect(
    [C, P, sumblk],
    connections=[
      ['P.u[0:2]', 'C.u[0:2]'],
      ['C.e[0:2]', 'sum.e[0:2]'],
      ['sum.y[0:2]', 'P.y[0:2]']
    ],
    inplist=['sum.r[0:2]', 'P.v[0:2]'],
    outlist=['P.y[0:2]', 'P.z[0:2]', 'C.u[0:2]']
  )

An even simpler form can be used by omitting the range specification
when all signals with the same prefix are used::

  clsys3 = ct.interconnect(
    [C, P, sumblk],
    connections=[['P.u', 'C.u'], ['C.e', 'sum.e'], ['sum.y', 'P.y']],
    inplist=['sum.r', 'P.v'], outlist=['P.y', 'P.z', 'C.u']
  )

A further simplification is possible when all of the inputs or outputs
of an individual system are used in a given specification::

  clsys4 = ct.interconnect(
    [C, P, sumblk],
    connections=[['P.u', 'C'], ['C', 'sum'], ['sum.y', 'P.y']],
    inplist=['sum.r', 'P.v'], outlist=['P', 'C.u']
  )

And finally, since we have named the signals throughout the system in a
consistent way, we could let :func:`~control.interconnect` do all of the
work::

  clsys5 = ct.interconnect(
    [C, P, sumblk], inplist=['sum.r', 'P.v'], outlist=['P', 'C.u']
  )

Various other simplifications are possible, but it can sometimes be
complicated to debug error message when things go wrong.  Setting
`debug=True` when calling :func:`~control.interconnect` prints out
information about how the arguments are processed that may be helpful
in understanding what is going wrong.

Automated creation of state feedback systems
--------------------------------------------

The :func:`~control.create_statefbk_iosystem` function can be used to
create an I/O system consisting of a state feedback gain (with
optional integral action and gain scheduling) and an estimator.  A
basic state feedback controller of the form

.. math::

  u = u_\text{d} - K (x - x_\text{d})

can be created with the command::

  ctrl, clsys = ct.create_statefbk_iosystem(sys, K)

where `sys` is the process dynamics and `K` is the state feedback gain
(e.g., from LQR).  The function returns the controller `ctrl` and the
closed loop systems `clsys`, both as I/O systems.  The input to the
controller is the vector of desired states :math:`x_\text{d}`, desired
inputs :math:`u_\text{d}`, and system states :math:`x`.

If the full system state is not available, the output of a state
estimator can be used to construct the controller using the command::

  ctrl, clsys = ct.create_statefbk_iosystem(sys, K, estimator=estim)

where `estim` is the state estimator I/O system.  The controller will
have the same form as above, but with the system state :math:`x`
replaced by the estimated state :math:`\hat x` (output of `estim`).
The closed loop controller will include both the state feedback and
the estimator.

Integral action can be included using the `integral_action` keyword.
The value of this keyword can either be a matrix (ndarray) or a
function.  If a matrix :math:`C` is specified, the difference between
the desired state and system state will be multiplied by this matrix
and integrated.  The controller gain should then consist of a set of
proportional gains :math:`K_\text{p}` and integral gains
:math:`K_\text{i}` with

.. math::

   K = \begin{bmatrix} K_\text{p} \\ K_\text{i} \end{bmatrix}

and the control action will be given by

.. math::

  u = u_\text{d} - K\text{p} (x - x_\text{d}) -
      K_\text{i} \int C (x - x_\text{d}) dt.

If `integral_action` is a function `h`, that function will be called
with the signature `h(t, x, u, params)` to obtain the outputs that
should be integrated.  The number of outputs that are to be integrated
must match the number of additional columns in the `K` matrix.  If an
estimator is specified, :math:`\hat x` will be used in place of
:math:`x`.

Finally, gain scheduling on the desired state, desired input, or
system state can be implemented by setting the gain to a 2-tuple
consisting of a list of gains and a list of points at which the gains
were computed, as well as a description of the scheduling variables::

  ctrl, clsys = ct.create_statefbk_iosystem(
      sys, ([g1, ..., gN], [p1, ..., pN]), gainsched_indices=[s1, ..., sq])

The list of indices can either be integers indicating the offset into
the controller input vector :math:`(x_\text{d}, u_\text{d}, x)` or a
list of strings matching the names of the input signals.  The
controller implemented in this case has the form

.. math::

  u = u_\text{d} - K(\mu) (x - x_\text{d})

where :math:`\mu` represents the scheduling variables.  See
:ref:`steering-gainsched.py` for an example implementation of a gain
scheduled controller (in the alternative formulation section at the
bottom of the file).

Integral action and state estimation can also be used with gain
scheduled controllers.
