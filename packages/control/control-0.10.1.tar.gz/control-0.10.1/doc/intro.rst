Introduction

Welcome to the Python Control Systems Toolbox (python-control) User's
Manual.  This manual contains information on using the python-control
package, including documentation for all functions in the package and
examples illustrating their use.

Overview of the toolbox
=======================

The python-control package is a set of python classes and functions that
implement common operations for the analysis and design of feedback control
systems.  The initial goal is to implement all of the functionality required
to work through the examples in the textbook `Feedback Systems
<http://fbsbook.org>`_ by Astrom and Murray. A :ref:`matlab-module` is
available that provides many of the common functions corresponding to
commands available in the MATLAB Control Systems Toolbox.

Some differences from MATLAB
============================
The python-control package makes use of `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org>`_ and
`SciPy <https://www.scipy.org>`_.  A list of general differences between
NumPy and MATLAB can be found `here
<https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html>`_.

In terms of the python-control package more specifically, here are
some things to keep in mind:

* You must include commas in vectors.  So [1 2 3] must be [1, 2, 3].
* Functions that return multiple arguments use tuples.  
* You cannot use braces for collections; use tuples instead.
* Time series data have time as the final index (see
  :ref:`time-series-convention`).

Installation
============

The `python-control` package can be installed using conda or pip.  The
package requires `NumPy`_ and `SciPy`_, and the plotting routines
require `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org>`_.  In addition, some
routines require the `Slycot
<https://github.com/python-control/Slycot>`_ library in order to
implement more advanced features (including some MIMO functionality).

For users with the Anaconda distribution of Python, the following
command can be used::

  conda install -c conda-forge control slycot

This installs `slycot` and `python-control` from conda-forge, including the
`openblas` package.  NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib will also be installed if
they are not already present.

.. note::
   Mixing packages from conda-forge and the default conda channel
   can sometimes cause problems with dependencies, so it is usually best to
   instally NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib from conda-forge as well.

To install using pip::

  pip install slycot   # optional
  pip install control

.. note::
   If you install Slycot using pip you'll need a development
   environment (e.g., Python development files, C and Fortran compilers).
   Pip installation can be particularly complicated for Windows.

Many parts of `python-control` will work without `slycot`, but some
functionality is limited or absent, and installation of `slycot` is
recommended. Users can check to insure that slycot is installed
correctly by running the command::

  python -c "import slycot"

and verifying that no error message appears. More information on the 
Slycot package can be obtained from the `Slycot project page
<https://github.com/python-control/Slycot>`_.

Alternatively, to install from source, first `download the source
<https://github.com/python-control/python-control/releases>`_ and unpack it.
To install in your home directory, use::

  pip install .

Getting started
===============

There are two different ways to use the package.  For the default interface
described in :ref:`function-ref`, simply import the control package as follows::

    >>> import control as ct

If you want to have a MATLAB-like environment, use the :ref:`matlab-module`::

    >>> from control.matlab import *
