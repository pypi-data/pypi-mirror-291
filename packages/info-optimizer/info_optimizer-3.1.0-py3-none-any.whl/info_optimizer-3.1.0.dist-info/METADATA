Weighted meaN oF vectOrs (INFO) Optimization Algorithm
This repository contains the implementation of INFO, a novel population-based optimization algorithm designed for solving complex optimization problems. INFO leverages a modified weighted mean approach to efficiently explore the search space and converge towards optimal solutions.

Algorithm Description
INFO distinguishes itself from conventional optimization methods through its unique three-stage process:

Updating Rule: Employs a mean-based law and convergence acceleration techniques to generate new candidate solutions (vectors) with enhanced exploration capabilities.

Vector Combining: Combines the newly generated vectors from the updating rule stage to create a promising solution, striking a balance between exploration and exploitation.

Local Search: Refines the solution obtained from the vector combining stage by conducting a local search, further improving exploitation and helping the algorithm escape local optima.

Key Features
Effective Exploration and Exploitation: The algorithm's design carefully balances exploration (searching new areas of the solution space) and exploitation (refining promising solutions) to efficiently find global optima.
Robust Performance: INFO has been rigorously tested on 48 mathematical benchmark functions and 5 constrained engineering problems, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing optimization algorithms.
High Accuracy: INFO consistently achieves high accuracy, converging to within 0.99% of the global optimum in engineering test cases, as evidenced by comparative studies.
Applications
The INFO algorithm holds significant promise for a wide range of optimization problems, including:

Engineering Design: Structural optimization, parameter tuning, and system identification.
Machine Learning: Hyperparameter optimization, feature selection, and neural network training.
Operations Research: Scheduling, resource allocation, and logistics optimization.
