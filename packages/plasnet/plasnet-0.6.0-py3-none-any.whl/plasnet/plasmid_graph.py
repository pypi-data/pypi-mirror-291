        Creates a plasmid graph from plasmid and distance files.

        The plasmid file is a tab-separated file with one column describing all plasmids in the dataset.
        Example of such file:
        plasmid
        AP024796.1
        AP024825.1
        CP012142.1
        CP014494.1
        CP019149.1
        CP021465.1
        CP022675.1
        CP024687.1
        CP026642.1
        CP027485.1

        The distance file is a tab-separated file with 3 columns: plasmid_1, plasmid_2, distance.
        plasmid_1 and plasmid_2 are plasmid names, and distance is a float between 0 and 1.
        The distance threshold is the minimum distance value for two plasmids to be considered connected.

        Example of such file:
        plasmid_1       plasmid_2       distance
        AP024796.1      AP024825.1      0.8
