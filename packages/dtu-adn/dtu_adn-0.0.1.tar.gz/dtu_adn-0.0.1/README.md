## Welcome to DTU 7k Bus Active Distribution Network

- The DTU-7k Bus Active Distribution Network is a multi-voltage level distribution grid model spanning across	three voltage levels, namely 60 kV-10 kV-0.4 kV. 		  
- The network is representative of a distribution network with a large share of weather-dependent generation connected at the lower voltage levels such as 10 kV and 400 V. 		  
- The DTU-ADN is developed considering the correlations between weather-dependent generation on the load demand. 	  	
- The DTU-ADN is in a format that can be directlt implemented in Python using Pypower or PandaPower, or in MATLAB using MATPOWER.
