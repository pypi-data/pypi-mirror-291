        Helper function for merging artifacts in a join step.
        
        This function takes all the artifacts coming from the branches of a
        join point and assigns them to self in the calling step. Only artifacts
        not set in the current step are considered. If, for a given artifact, different
        values are present on the incoming edges, an error will be thrown and the artifacts
        that conflict will be reported.
        
        As a few examples, in the simple graph: A splitting into B and C and joining in D:
        ```
        A:

          self.y = 6
        B:

        In D, the following artifacts are set:
          - `y` (value: 6), `b_var` (value: 1)
          - if `from_b` and `from_c` are the same, `x` will be accessible and have value `from_b`
          - if `from_b` and `from_c` are different, an error will be thrown. To prevent this error,
            you need to manually set `self.x` in D to a merged value (for example the max) prior to
            calling `merge_artifacts`.

            Cannot specify if `include` is also specified.

        - Static fan-out connection: `self.next(self.step1, self.step2, ...)` where `stepX` are
          methods in the current class decorated with the `@step` decorator.
        
        - Foreach branch:
          ```
          self.next(self.foreach_step, foreach='foreach_iterator')
          ```
          In this situation, `foreach_step` is a method in the current class decorated with the
          `@step` decorator and `foreach_iterator` is a variable name in the current class that
